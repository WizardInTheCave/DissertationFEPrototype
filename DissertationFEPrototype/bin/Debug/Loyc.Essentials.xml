            This class enhances LINQ-to-Objects with extension methods that preserve the
            interface (e.g. Take(IList&lt;int>) returns a struct that implements IList&lt;int>)
            or have higher performance than the ones in System.Linq.Enumerable.
            </summary><remarks>
            For example, the <see cref="!:Enumerable.Last()"/> extension 
            method scans the entire list before returning the last item, while 
            <see cref="!:Last(IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;)"/> and <see cref="!:Last(IList&lt;T&gt;)"/> simply
            return the last item directly.

            <summary>A compact auto-enlarging deque structure that is intended to be

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This type is implemented with what is commonly called a "circular buffer".
            There is a single array plus a "start index" and a count. The array may or 
            may not be divided into two "halves", depending on the circumstances.
            The first element of the DList (returned from this[0] and from the
            First property) is located at the "start index" of the array; and if the 
            start index + count is greater than the array size, then the end of the 
            DList wraps around to the beginning of the array.
            <para/>
            InternalDeque is a struct, not a class, in order to save memory; and for 
            maximum performance, it asserts rather than throwing an exception 
            when an incorrect array index is used (the one exception is the iterator,
            which throws in case the collection is modified during enumeration; this 
            is for the sake of <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.DList`1"/>.) For these and other reasons, 
            one should not expose it in a public API, and it should only be used when 
            performance is very important.
            <para/>
            Also, do not use the <c>default(InternalDList{T})</c> or the equivalent
            "default constructor", which only exists because C# requires it. Always 
            specify an initial capacity or copy InternalDeque.Empty so that the 
            internal array gets a value. All methods in this structure assume _array 
            is not null.
            <para/>
            This class does not implement <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IDeque`1"/> and <see 
            cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/> in order to help you not to shoot yourself in the foot.
            The problem is that any extension methods used with those interfaces that 
            change the list, such as PopLast(), malfunction because the structure is
            implicitly boxed, producing a shallow copy. By not implementing those 
            interfaces, the extension methods are not available, ensuring you don't
            accidently box the structure. If you need those interfaces, You can always 
            call <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalDList`1.AsDList"/> to construct a <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.DList`1"/> in O(1) 
            time.
            <para/>
            You may be curious why <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1"/>, in contrast, DOES
            implement <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/>. It's because there is no way to make
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/> from <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1"/> in O(1) time;
            so boxing the <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1"/> is the only fast way to get
            an instance of <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/>.

            An <a href="http://core.loyc.net/collections/internal-list.html">article</a>
            about this class is available.
            <para/>
            InternalList is a struct, not a class, in order to save memory; and for 
            maximum performance, it asserts rather than throwing an exception 
            when an incorrect array index is used. Besides that, it has an 
            InternalArray property that provides access to the internal array. 
            For all these reasons one should not expose it in a public API, and 
            it should only be used when performance trumps all other concerns.
            <para/>
            Passing this structure by value is dangerous because changes to a copy 
            of the structure may or may not be reflected in the original list. It's
            best not to pass it around at all, but if you must pass it, pass it by
            reference.
            <para/>
            Also, do not use the default contructor. Always specify an initial 
            capacity or copy InternalList.Empty so that _array gets a value. 
            This is required because methods such as Add(), Insert() and Resize() 
            assume _array is not null.
            <para/>
            InternalList has one nice thing that List(of T) lacks: a <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1.Resize(System.Int32)"/>
            method and an equivalent Count setter. Which dork at Microsoft decided no 
            one should be allowed to set the list length directly? This type also 
            provides a handy <see cref="P:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1.Last"/> property and a <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1.Pop"/> 
            method to respectively get or remove the last item.
            <para/>
            Finally, alongside InternalList(T), the static class InternalList comes 
            with some static methods (CopyToNewArray, Insert, RemoveAt, Move) to help
            manage raw arrays. You might want to use these in a data structure 
            implementation even if you choose not to use InternalList(T) instances.

            (1.75 to the 1.239th power is about 2.0), but memory utilization is
            increased. With size doubling, the average list uses 2/3 of its 
            entries, but with this resizing pattern, the average list uses 72.72%
            of its entries. The average size of a list is 8.3% lower. Originally
            I used 50% size increases, but they required 71% more allocations,

            <remarks>
            Normally one uses Array.Sort for sorting arrays.
            This method exists because there is no Array.Sort overload that
            accepts both a Comparison and a range (index, count), nor does the
            .NET framework provide access to its internal adapter that converts 
            Comparison to IComparer.
            <para/>
            This quicksort algorithm uses a best-of-three pivot so that it remains
            performant (fast) if the input is already sorted. It is designed to 
            perform reasonably well in case the data contains many duplicates (not
            verified). It is also designed to avoid using excessive stack space if 
            a worst-case input occurs that requires O(N^2) time.

            This quicksort algorithm uses a best-of-three pivot so that it remains
            performant (fast) if the input is already sorted. It is designed to 
            perform reasonably well in case the data contains many duplicates (not
            verified). It is also designed to avoid using excessive stack space if 
            a worst-case input occurs that requires O(N^2) time.

            On larger inputs, this algorithm uses a quicksort and therefore runs 
            in O(N log N) time, but it requires O(N) temporary space (specifically, 
            an array of N integers) and is slower than a standard quicksort, so 
            you should use it only if you need a stable sort or if the input is
            usually small (in which case insertion sort is used).

            invoke Clone() directly because the compiler complains that Clone() is 
            ambiguous. Consequently it is necessary to cast the range to <see 
            cref="T:Loyc.ICloneable`1"/> just to clone it; if R is a value type then it is
            boxed, which defeats the entire performance advantage of calling

            <para/>
            Nevertheless, I have left the constraint in place, in the hope that EC# can 
            eventually eliminate this limitation thanks to its "using" cast. Once EC#
            compiles directly to CIL, <c>range(using ICloneable&lt;R>).Clone()</c> will

            <remarks>
            To get an instance of this interface from a string, write
            <c>new StringSlice("string")</c> or <c>(UString)"string"</c>.
            <para/>
            This is the standard interface for lexers to use as a source of 
            characters; is it defined in Loyc.Essentials rather than Loyc.Syntax
            so that <see cref="T:Loyc.UString"/> and <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.StringSlice"/> can 
            implement it.
            <para/>
            This interface was created to read characters more efficiently. 
            Although a lexer could read characters one-at-a-time from 
            IReadOnlyList{char} or IListSource{char}, it requires dynamic interface 
            dispatch for every character. On the other hand, if lexers avoid this 
            overhead by requiring the entire file in the form of a string, it becomes 
            necessary to hold the entire file in memory at once, in a very specific 
            format (a string).
            <para/>
            Slice() allows the lexer to request small pieces of the file that
            it can read without dynamic dispatch. Typically a lexer will be
            derived from Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer, which requests rather 
            small chunks; the ICharSource implementation is is free to read 
            larger blocks at once, since the return type, <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.StringSlice"/>,
            can be a slice of a larger string.
            <para/>
            This interface provides good efficiency when reading from strings, 
            or from data structures composed of large strings (most notably, 
            this interface could efficiently return sections of a gap buffer),
            but unlike String itself, it is flexible, and does not require
            the entire file to be held in memory as a single contiguous block.
            <para/>
            It's unfortunate that .NET treats strings as something completely 
            different than arrays. Otherwise, this interface could support not
            just substrings, but subarrays of any element type, which would be
            useful any time you want to optimize your code by reducing dynamic 
            dispatch.
            <para/>
            Note about Count: if ICharSource represents to a file or other Stream,
            reading Count forces the entire stream to be scanned in order to determine
            the number of characters in the file (which may be different from the number 
            of bytes). Rather than do a test like <c>if (index >= charSource.Count)</c>
            it is better to use <c>if (Slice(index, 1).Count == 0)</c>, or better yet,
            <c>TryGet(index, out fail)</c>.

            <remarks>
            This interface should be implemented by "sparse" data structures that are 
            optimized for lists that have large gaps in them; for example, a sparse 
            data structure with <c>Count == 1000000</c> might really contain only a 
            few elements, or it could even be completely empty. The <c>Count</c> of a 
            sparse list tells you the range of valid indexes that you are allowed to 
            read, but since any or all of the space might be empty, it only gives an 
            upper bound, not a lower bound, of the true size of the list.
            <para/>
            When you read <c>list[i]</c>, and <c>i</c> is within an empty area of the 
            sparse list, a default value is returned, which is normally <c>default(T)</c>.
            <para/>
            As an example, <c>SortedDictionary&lt;int, T></c> could be viewed as a sparse
            list. Assuming the dictionary has no negative integers, you could create a 
            wrapper around <c>SortedDictionary&lt;int, T></c> that implements this 
            interface as follows:
            <ul>
            <li><c>Count</c> returns <c>int.MaxValue</c>,</li>
            <li><see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.ISparseListSource`1.NextHigherItem(System.Nullable{System.Int32}@)"/> and <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.ISparseListSource`1.NextLowerItem(System.Nullable{System.Int32}@)"/> do a linear scan 
            to find the next higher or lower key that exists.</li>
            <li><see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.ISparseListSource`1.IsSet(System.Int32)"/> returns the result of <see cref="M:System.Collections.Generic.SortedDictionary`2.ContainsKey(`0)"/>, and</li>
            <li><see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.IListSource`1.TryGet(System.Int32,System.Boolean@)"/> returns the value 
            retrieved by <see cref="M:System.Collections.Generic.SortedDictionary`2.TryGetValue(`0,`1@)"/>, setting 'fail'
            only if the index is negative.</li>
            </ul>
            <c>SortedDictionary</c> is not a very useful example in practise, though,
            because it does not provide a way for <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.ISparseListSource`1.NextHigherItem(System.Nullable{System.Int32}@)"/> and
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.ISparseListSource`1.NextLowerItem(System.Nullable{System.Int32}@)"/> to work efficiently, and it cannot efficiently 
            support the <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.ISparseList`1"/> interface. A more useful example
            is SparseAList{T} in Loyc.Collections.dll, which efficiently implements 
            this interface and <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.ISparseList`1"/>.

            This class contains extension methods that are provided as part of various 
            Loyc.Collections interfaces. For example, it provides methods such as IndexOf(),
            Contains() and CopyTo(), that the traditional <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection`1"/> 
            and <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/> interfaces require the author to write himself.

            <remarks>
            For covariant collections such as <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyCollection`1"/> and <see 
            cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IListSource`1"/>, the CLR actually prohibits methods such as 
            Contains(T) and IndexOf(T), because T is not allowed in "input" positions. 
            Therefore, these extension methods must be used to fill the gap. Even
            methods such as <i>bool TryGet(int, out T)</i> are prohibited, so TryGet()
            has the signature <i>T TryGet(ref bool failed)</i> instead, and extension
            methods provide the original version of the method in addition.

            At first, this method was a member of IListSource itself, just in 
            case the source might have some kind of fast lookup logic (e.g. binary 
            search) or custom comparer. However, since the item to find is an "in" 
            argument, it would prevent IListSource from being marked covariant when
            I upgrade to C# 4.

            <summary>Represents a sparse list that allows insertion and removal of items
            and empty spaces. In a sparse list, some spaces can be "clear" meaning that 
            they have no value.</summary>
            <typeparam name="T"></typeparam>
            <remarks>
            Classes that implement this interface should be designed so that large empty 
            spaces in the list consume no memory, or very little memory. Furthermore,
            insertions and removals at random indexes should take no more than O(M) 
            amortized time to complete, where M is the number of elements actually set
            (non-empty spaces), and Count >= M. (Sparse lists do not have to keep track
            of M itself, though, so there is no property to retrieve this value).
            <para/>
            This interface has special methods for creating empty spaces: 
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.ISparseList`1.ClearSpace(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/> and <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.ISparseList`1.InsertSpace(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>.
            The implementation can treat all other insertions and changes as non-empty
            values; for example, given code like
            <code>
            ISparseList&lt;T> list = ...;
            foreach (int i in Enumerable.Range(1000))
                list.Add(default(T));
            </code>
            A sparse list is allowed to treat the last 1000 items as "clear" (saving 
            memory) or "set" (allocating memory) depending on how it is implemented. 
            Since the .NET framework does not allow fast bitwise comparisons of a 
            generic T (in other words, there is no fast, generic way to compare a T 
            value with default(T)), implementations will typically treat the last 1000 
            items as "set" and unnecessarily allocate memory for them. Blame Microsoft.
            <para/>
            This interface has no method to insert another sparse list into the current 
            one, but <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.ISparseListEx`1"/> does.
            <para/>
            A sparse list is allowed to behave like <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IAutoSizeArray`1"/> when 
            setting an invalid non-negative index. When you set <c>this[i]</c> where 
            i >= 0, the <c>Count</c> may automatically increase to <c>i + 1</c> if 
            necessary, <i>or</i> the setter may throw <see cref="T:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException"/>.
            Even if the setter succeeds, the getter of <c>this[i]</c> may still throw 
            <see cref="T:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException"/> when <c>i</c> is an invalid index.
            <para/>
            The indexer (<c>this[i]</c>) returns a default value, typically 
            <c>default(T)</c>, when the specified index is valid but clear.
            <para/>
            Sparse list implementations do <i>not</i> have to perfectly track which 
            spaces are clear and which spaces are set; in particular, implementations
            are allowed to return <c>true</c> from <c>IsSet</c> for any valid index.
            <ul>
            <li>If the default value is <c>t</c> and you set <c>this[i] = t</c>, a 
            sparse list is allowed to return true or false from <c>IsSet(i)</c>.</li>
            <li>After you call <c>Clear(i)</c>, a sparse list is still allowed to 
            return true from <c>IsSet(i)</c>.</li>
            <li>After you set <c>this[i] = v</c> where <c>v</c> is not the default 
            value, <c>IsSet(i)</c> <i>must</i> return true.</li>
            </ul>
            The purpose of this freedom is to permit implementations that use arrays
            of T[] for regions that are mostly filled. For example, if 95 out of 100
            indexes in a certain region are filled, an implementation may decide it 
            is more efficient to use an array that discards information about the 
            empty spaces.
            <para/>
            On the other hand, some implementations are precise, and will always 
            report that <c>IsSet(i)==false</c> after you call <c>Clear(i)</c> or
            <c>InsertSpace(i)</c>.

            <remarks>
            Ranges are a concept I first saw formalized in the D programming language.
            They are generally more useful than .NET enumerators because there are 
            more kinds of them:
            <ul>
            <li>A forward range (<see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1"/>) is a sequence of values 
            accessed starting with the first, like <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator`1"/>. A 
            forward range is like IEnumerator, except that it can be cloned, so you 
            can restart from the same place later. This is more powerful than 
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1"/>, which can only restart from the beginning.</li>
            <li>A bidirectional range inherits from the forward range, and provides
            access to the back of the sequence as well as the front. A bidirectional
            iterators may, for example, represent a linked list, or a UTF-8 string 
            that provides access to the first and last 32-bit code point (note that
            random access by character index is not really possible in UTF-8 data,
            since the size of N characters is unknown).</li>
            <li>A random-access range is a sequence that provides array-like access
            to a section of a list. A section of a list is called a "slice".</li>
            </ul>
            A range is read-only by default, but has a writable variant marked
            with the letter M, meaning "Mutable": <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IMFRange`1"/>, 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IMBRange`1"/>, <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IMRange`1"/>.
            <para/>
            It is fair to ask why IFRange exists--since it behaves like an enumerator,
            why not simply use IEnumerator directly? Well, this interface serves as 
            the base interface for the other ranges, so its interface needs to make
            sense in that context. IEnumerator has "Current" and "MoveNext" methods,
            but in a bidirectional or random-access range, there is no single 
            "Current" or "Next" item.
            <para/>
            Also, when used through an interface, IFRange is potentially more 
            efficient than IEnumerator: you only need to call a single method, 
            PopFirst(), to get the next item, unlike IEnumerator which requires two 
            interface calls per iteration. That can improve performance, since 
            interface calls cannot be inlined. It is a bit inconvenient to use
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1.PopFirst(System.Boolean@)"/> because of its "out" argument, and 
            more convenient extension methods would have been provided if C# 
            supported "ref Type this", which would be needed since ranges are
            often value types.
            <para/>
            Ranges are useful for implementing algorithms; they are comparable to
            the concept of "iterators" in C++, except that a range represents a 
            pair of iterators instead of a single iterator. And like C++ iterators,
            they are a useful starting point for writing generic algorithms.
            <para/>
            When using a range that is not typed <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1"/>, you need to
            be careful how you use it because the range could be a struct type. Much 
            like an enumerator, a range is often a small wrapper around a larger data
            structure; therefore, it often makes sense to implement a range as a 
            struct. When a range is a struct, normally you are making a copy of it 
            whenever you assign it to a different variable, or pass it to another 
            method:
            <code>
                Range b = a;
                a.PopFirst(); // may not affect b if Range is a struct
            </code>
            In fact, a range should not be copied this way because assignment may or
            may not create a copy. You should avoid simple assignment, and use 
            Clone() to copy a range instead:
            <code>
                Range b = a.Clone();
                a.PopFirst(); // will not affect b, and you can be sure of it
            </code>
            However, if a range is a reference type or a reference to IFRange, you 
            are not making a copy of it when you assign it or pass it to another 
            method:
            <code>
                IFRange&lt;T> a = ...;
                IFRange&lt;T> b = a;
                a.PopFirst(); // The item was popped from b also
            </code>
            When writing generic code, you may want to use range types directly, as in:
            <code>
                void DoSomethingWithRange&lt;R,T>(R range) where R : IRange&lt;T> {...}
            </code>
            Using a range type directly can improve performance if R happens to be 
            a struct type, since there is no need to box the range when passing it 
            to this method. However, it is very important to keep in mind that "R" 
            may be a struct or a class. If this method is not intended to modify the 
            range from the perspective of the caller, the method must start by cloning 
            the range, in case R is a class or interface type:
            <code>
                void DoSomethingWithRange&lt;R,T>(R range) where R : IBRange&lt;T> {
                    range = range.Clone();
                    ...
                }
            </code>
            On the other hand, if this method <i>wants</i> the caller to see the 
            changes to the range, R must be passed by reference, in case it is a
            struct type:
            <code>
                void DoSomethingWithRange&lt;R,T>(ref R range) where R : IBRange&lt;T> {
                    ...
                }
            </code>
            To avoid these subtle difficulties, you can access the range through
            the <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1"/> interface; just remember to Clone() the 
            range when necessary.
            <para/>
            Remember that a range is an alias for some underlying data structure.
            If the original data structure is modified, a range will "see" those
            changes. For instance, suppose that a range provides a slice from 
            indexes 5 to 12 inclusive within an <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/> object 
            that contains 15 items:
            <pre>
                IList  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 
                       a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o 
                IRange                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
            </pre>
            Thus, [0] in the range corresponds to item [5] in the list, "f". Now, 
            if the first three items in the list are removed, then [0] in the range 
            will still correspond to item [5] in the list, but the item at this 
            location, marked "i", used to be at index [8]:
            <pre>
                IList  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
                       d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o
                IRange                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
            </pre>
            The exact behavior of the range at this point is implementation-dependent.
            The <c>Count</c> property may remain at 8, or it may drop to 7; perhaps the
            range will return default(T) when you read index [7], or perhaps it will
            throw <see cref="T:System.IndexOutOfRangeException"/>. Because of this lack of
            predictability, you should avoid keeping a range that points to a list whose
            size is decreasing. If individual elements are modified but not the list 
            size, the range is safe to use and will see the changes. If new elements 
            are added to the end of the list, the range may or may not continue working 
            as expected, depending on how the collection works and how the range works.
            In most cases the range will be unaffected, in contrast to common C++ 
            containers such as <c>std::vector</c>, in which iterators are "invalidated" 
            by any size change, and when an invalid iterator is accessed, it may return 
            bad data or crash the program.
            <para/>
            Currently there are no interfaces in Loyc.Essentials that return forward or 
            bidirectional ranges; the only notable method that returns a range is
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.IListSource`1.Slice(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>, which returns a random-access range.
            Since a random-access range is also a bidirectional range, you can begin
            writing algorithms that accept forward and bidirectional ranges (for read 
            access). Any collection that implements <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IListSource`1"/> can 
            be treated as a range using the <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.ListExt.AsRange``1(Loyc.Collections.IListSource{``0})"/> 
            extension method, which is like calling <c>Slice(0)</c>.
            <para/>
            The design philosophy of Loyc.Essentials is that potentially useful 
            interfaces should be included even if there are no implementations of the 
            interface. That's why there are interfaces like <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IMFRange`1"/>
            that are not implemented by any classes. Why offer unused interfaces?
            Because this library is designed to be extended by third parties, who

            <para/>
            The mutable ranges do not include a clone method due to a limitation of C#.
            C# does not support covariance, which means that every time a derived 
            interface supports cloning, the implementing class is required to write a 
            separate clone method. Read-only ranges already have to implement up to 
            four clone methods: ICloneable{IFRange{T}}, ICloneable{IBRange{T}}, 
            ICloneable{IRange{T}}, and ICloneable{IRangeEx{T}}, and that's in addition 
            to the Clone method for the concrete type! If mutable ranges also supported
            cloning, they would add up to three more clone methods, which is really 
            getting out of hand.
            <para/>
            To limit the maximum number of clone methods to something reasonable, only 
            the immutable ranges have a clone method, but if the original range was 
            mutable then the clone will also be mutable; you just have to cast the 
            result:
            <code>
                var r2 = (IMFRange&lt;T>)r.Clone();

            The term "source" means a read-only collection, as opposed to a "sink" which
            is a write-only collection. The purpose of IListSource is to support slices,
            eliminate the need to call <c>Count</c> before reading from the list, and to
            make it easier to implement a read-only list, by lifting IList's requirement 
            to write implementations for Add(), Remove(), etc. A secondary purpose is, 
            of course, to guarantee users don't mistakenly call those methods on a 
            read-only collection.
            <para/>
            I have often wanted to access the "next" or "previous" item in a list, e.g.
            during parsing, but it inconvenient if you have to worry about whether the 
            the current item is the first or last. In that case you must check whether
            the array index is valid, which is both inconvenient and wasteful, because
            the list class itself will check the array index a second time, and then the 
            .NET runtime will check the index a third time when reading the internal 
            array. The <c>TryGet(index, defaultValue)</c> extension method can be used 
            to return a default value if the index is not valid, using only one 
            interface call.
            <para/>
            Design footnote: I would have preferred to define <c>TryGet</c> with one of 
            these signatures:
            <code>
                bool TryGet(int index, out T value);
                T? TryGet(int index);
                Maybe&lt;T> TryGet(int index);
            </code>
            However, these signatures don't allow T to be covariant (<c>out T</c>). 
            The first signature doesn't work because the .NET runtime doesn't distinguish
            between <c>ref</c> and <c>out</c>, so T could not be covariant. The second
            signature doesn't work if <c>T</c> is not a value type. The third signature
            doesn't work because, as a struct, <c>Maybe&lt;T></c> is not allowed to be
            covariant (even though the JIT could, theoretically, treat it covariantly).
            <para/>
            Using <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.ListSourceBase`1"/> as your base class can help you
            implement this interface more quickly.

            This approach to change notification is more lightweight than the standard
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Specialized.INotifyCollectionChanged"/> interface because that interface
            sends both a list of new items and a list of old items, so many changes
            require a pair of temporary objects to be created that hold the two lists
            of items.
            <para/>
            In contrast, the <see cref="E:Loyc.Collections.INotifyListChanging`1.ListChanging"/> event includes only one list 
            that specifies the set of new items. In the case of Remove events, no change
            list is included. Since the collection has not been modified yet, the user
            handling the event can examine the list to learn which item(s) are being
            removed; if the list is being changed, it can similarly examine the list
            to see the old set of items.
            <para/>
            An optimization is available when only a single item is being added or
            changed. In that case, the collection class should create a lightweight 
            read-only single-item list by calling <see cref="!:Range.Single&lt;T&gt;(T)"/>.
            Such a list has less overhead than <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/> and the same
            overhead as an array of one item.

            <remarks>
            This class is a decorator for the Thread class and thus a

            .NET itself has no support whatsoever from inheriting thread-local 
            variables. Not only are thread locals not inherited from the parent
            thread, .NET fires no event when a thread starts and a child thread
            cannot get the thread ID of the thread that created it.
            <para/>
            ThreadEx helps work around this problem by automatically propagating
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Threading.ThreadLocalVariable`1"/> values, and providing the 
            <see cref="E:Loyc.Threading.ThreadEx.ThreadStarting"/> event, which blocks the parent thread but
            is called in the child thread. This only works if you use <see cref="T:Loyc.Threading.ThreadEx"/>
            to start the child thread; when using other mechanisms such as
            <see cref="T:System.Threading.Tasks.Task"/>, it is possible to copy thread-
            local variables from the parent thread using code like this:
            <code>
            int parentThreadId = Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId;
            var task = System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
            	using (ThreadEx.PropagateVariables(parentThreadId))
            		DoSomethingOnChildThread();
            });
            task.Wait();
            </code>
            Be careful, however: you should guarantee that, while you copy the 
            variables, the parent thread is blocked, or that the parent thread will not 
            modify any of them (which may be difficult since variables might exist that
            you are unaware of, that you do not control).

            more importantly, .NET does not propagate thread-local variables when 
            creating new threads, which is a huge problem if you want to implement

            thread to a child thread, but because .NET provides no way to hook into
            thread creation, it only works if you use <see cref="T:Loyc.Threading.ThreadEx"/> instead

            ThreadLocalVariable(of T) is less convenient than the [ThreadStatic]

            install a propagator function to customize the way the variable is 
            copied (e.g. in case you need a deep copy).
            <para/>
            Despite my optimizations, ThreadLocalVariable is just over half as fast 
            as a ThreadStatic variable in CLR 2.0, in a test with no thread 
            contention. Access to the dictionary accounts for almost half of the 
            execution time; try-finally (needed in case of asyncronous exceptions) 
            blocks use up 11%; calling Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId takes 
            about 9%; and the rest, I presume, is used up by the TinyReaderWriterLock.

            TODO: consider switching from TinyReaderWriterLock+Dictionary to 
            ConcurrentDictionary which has fine-grained locking (.NET 4 only).

             assigned it.</summary>
             <remarks>
             ScratchBuffer is typically used as a static variable to hold a temporary
             object used for operations that are done frequently and require a 
             temporary memory space--but only during the operation, not afterward.
             <para/>
             For example, CPTrie may require a temporary byte array during searches.
             Re-creating the byte array for every search might cause a too much time
             to be spent garbage-collecting. On the other hand, if CPTrie keeps a 
             reference to the temporary buffer in itself, what if a program contains 
             many instances of CPTrie? Each one would have its own separate temporary
             buffer, wasting memory. The buffer can't be a straightforward global
             variable, either, in case two threads need a scratch buffer at once.
             ScratchBuffer, then, exists to prevent two threads from using the same 
             buffer.
             <para/>
             ScratchBuffer is designed with the assumption that creating a scratch
             buffer is fast, but re-using an existing buffer is faster. Since 
             creating a scratch buffer is cheap already, this class is worthless 
             unless it is even cheaper. Therefore, it does not hold a buffer for 
             each thread, since managing multiple buffers would be too expensive; 
             and volatile variable access is used instead of locking.
             <para/>
             ScratchBuffer originally returned null if the scratch buffer had not 
             been initialized or was associated with a different thread, requiring
             the caller to create a new buffer manually. Now there is a new constructor 
             that takes a factory function, which is called automatically by the Value
             property if the scratch buffer is null or belongs to another thread. If
             you use this constructor, then you do longer have to worry about Value 
             returning null.
             <example>
             static ScratchBuffer&lt;byte[]&gt; _buf = 
                new ScratchBuffer&lt;byte[]&gt;(() => new byte[40]);
            
             // A method called a million times that needs a scratch buffer each time
             void FrequentOperation()
             {
            		byte[] buf = _buf.Value;
                 
                 // do something here involving the buffer ...
             }
             </example>
             Arguably it is better to use a [ThreadStatic] variable is instead of 
             ScratchBuffer, but FWIW [ThreadStatic] is not available on the .NET
             Compact Framework.

            ShiftLeft and ShiftRight operations are commonly thought of as binary 
            operations, but some algorithms need to multiply numbers by powers of two 
            and want to do so efficiently, while still supporting floating-point types. 
            Therefore it makes sense to offer ShiftLeft ("multiply by a power of two")
            and ShiftRight ("divide by a power of two") operators as part of the 
            multiple/divide interface, not just <see cref="T:Loyc.Math.IBinaryMath`1"/>. Even 
            floating-point types can support these two operations efficiently by 
            directly modifying the exponent part of the floating-point representation.

            WARNING: When casting a point (or vector) structure to this interface, 
            it is boxed, making a copy. Changes made through a reference to IPoint do 
            not affect the original point!
            <para/>
            It is important to distinguish between generic code that operates on points
            (e.g. Foo&lt;Point,T>(Point x) where Point:IPoint&lt;T>) and code that uses 
            the IPoint interface directly (e.g. Foo(IPoint&lt;int>) or even 
            Foo&lt;T>(IPoint&lt;T> x)). The latter uses slow, late-bound interface 
            calls and the boxing-copy issue mentioned before must be kept in mind.
            Generic code that uses IPoint as a <i>constraint</i>, not as a <i>parameter 
            type,</i> is faster and does not have the same problem because it does not 
            actually box the point, nor does it use late-bound invocation.
            <para/>
            Normally this interface is not used directly, and the only operation
            provided is New(). It is provided in case you want it, but generally
            it's better to use <see cref="!:Point&lt;T&gt;"/>.
            <para/>
            In order for this interface to work more easily in generic code, there is 
            no corresponding IVector type for vectors because generic code must declare 
            every type it needs as a separate type parameter, which makes the code very 
            cumbersome to write already, even without a point/vector distinction.
            <para/>
            The New() method is not normally used in generic code because it returns 
            IPoint&lt;T>, not the original point type. It is provided mainly in case 
            somebody wants to use the raw interface to manipulate points.
            <para/>
            Due to a limitation of C#, the X and Y coordinates are separated into a 
            separate interface (<see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPointBase`1"/>) from the New() method in
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.INewPoint`2"/>. Without this separation, it's impossible 
            to write fast generic code that can operate on both IPoint itself and on 
            concrete types such as <see cref="!:Point&lt;T&gt;"/>. The reason for this is very 
            subtle. To understand it, consider the following generic method that adds 
            two points together:
            <para/>
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M>(this M m, Point a, Point b)
            	where Point : IPoint&lt;T>
            	where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T>
            {
            	return a.New(m.Add(a.X, b.X), m.Add(a.Y, b.Y));
            }
            </code>
            As written, this code does not compile. The reason is that a.New() does not 
            return a Point; instead, it returns <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPoint`1"/>, which is a more 
            general (interface) type than Point (which is probably a struct). Therefore, 
            in order for the code above to work, a cast from IPoint to Point would be 
            necessary. However, the boxing performed by new() and the unboxing performed 
            by the cast will slow down the method. My goal, however, is to allow generic
            code to run fast; otherwise it's hard to justify the extra effort required 
            to make the code generic. After all, the code to add non-generic points is
            trivial in comparison:
            <code>
            public static PointD Add(PointD a, PointD b) { return a + b; }
            </code>
            You might think to yourself, "okay, why don't we just add a new() 
            constraint on Point?" In that case the Add() method can be written as 
            follows:
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M>(this M m, Point a, Point b)
            	where Point : IPoint&lt;T>, new()
            	where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T>
            {
            	Point p = new Point();
            	p.X = m.Add(a.X, b.X);
            	p.Y = m.Add(a.Y, b.Y);
            	return p;
            }
            </code>
            This works if the input is a concrete point type, but this version of the 
            method cannot be used if Point happens to be <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPoint`1"/> itself;
            you cannot do "new IPoint" because it is an interface. To solve this I 
            considered splitting out New() into a separate interface and using it as a 
            constraint of the generic method:
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M>(this M m, Point a, Point b)
            	where Point : IPoint&lt;T>, INewPoint&lt;Point, T>
            	where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T>
            {
            	return a.New(m.Add(a.X, b.X), m.Add(a.Y, b.Y));
            }
            </code>
            This code compiles under one condition: IPoint must <i>not</i> be derived 
            from INewPoint&lt;IPoint&lt;T>,T>. Because if it is, then the call to New()
            is ambiguous: does a.New() refer to INewPoint&lt;IPoint&lt;T>,T>.New() or 
            to INewPoint&lt;Point,T>.New()? Remember, IPoint is not the same as Point 
            from the compiler's perspective--IPoint is an interface, but Point is 
            typically a struct (it could be the same as IPoint, but in general, it is 
            not). The compiler doesn't know which version of New() to call, so it 
            refuses to compile the code. It will compile if we change the method body 
            to 
            <code>
            	return ((INewPoint&lt;Point,T>)a).New(m.Add(a.X, b.X), m.Add(a.Y, b.Y));
            </code>
            The cast resolves the ambiguity, but as a side-effect, 'a' is boxed and 
            the call to New() becomes a virtual call that cannot be inlined. So the 
            same performance penalty is back!
            <para/>
            But as I was saying, the original code does compile if IPoint is <i>not</i>
            derived from INewPoint. Unfortunately, if IPoint is not derived from 
            INewPoint then it is impossible to pass a reference to IPoint to this 
            method (because it no longer meets the constraints). Remember, that is 
            the limitation I am trying to avoid!
            <para/>
            One more "solution" is not to create any new points:
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M>(this M m, Point a, Point b)
            	where Point : IPoint&lt;T>
            	where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T>
            {
            	a.X = m.Add(a.X, b.X);
            	a.Y = m.Add(a.Y, b.Y);
            	return a;
            }
            </code>
            Alas, this version of the code modifies the point 'a' if Point is IPoint, 
            but it does not modify 'a' if Point is a struct, because structs are passed 
            by value. This inconsistency is not acceptable, and besides, there are
            (of course) situations where creating new points is required.
            <para/>
            The problem is that if there is only one New() method defined (in the 
            point structures such as PointI and PointD) then it's impossible to pass
            references to IPoint to Add(); however, if there are two New() methods (one 
            in the point struct and one in IPoint), it is impossible to tell the C# 
            compiler which method we want to call without slowing down the code as a 
            side-effect. My solution to this very peculiar problem is to split IPoint
            into two independent interfaces, IPointBase and INewPoint. This separation
            allows us to tell the C# compiler that Point implements only one of the 
            New() methods, not both:
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M>(this M m, Point a, Point b)
                where Point : IPointBase&lt;T>, INewPoint&lt;Point, T>
                where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T>
            {
                return a.New(m.Add(a.X, b.X), m.Add(a.Y, b.Y));
            }
            </code>
            IPointBase, unlike IPoint, does not have a New() method, so only the 
            New() method in INewPoint&lt;Point, T> is available to be called, and the 
            C# compiler stops complaining. Also, since IPoint&lt;T> implements both 
            IPointBase&lt;T> and INewPoint&lt;IPoint&lt;T>, T>, it meets the generic
            constraints of this method and can be passed to it.
            <para/>
            Note that you don't have to write methods like Add() yourself (they are 
            provided as extension methods on IPoint.) Still, if you've read this far,
            you're probably now afraid of the effort required to write generic code! 
            Your fear may be justified. But there is another, easier way that you can 
            write generic code, based on <see cref="!:Point&lt;T&gt;"/> instead of IPoint:
            <code>
            public static Point&lt;T> Add&lt;T>(Point&lt;T> a, Point&lt;T> b)
            {
            	return a+b;
            }
            </code>
            A lot easier without all those constraints, yes? The main disadvantage of 
            this version is that it doesn't have great performance, because the 
            additions are done through interface calls. A second disadvantage is that 
            you can't pass an IPoint to it. That's okay because as stated before, 
            normally the IPoint interface is not used directly!
            <para/>
            Code that uses Point&lt;T,M> can run faster:
            <code>
            public static Point&lt;T,M> Add&lt;T,M>(Point&lt;T,M> a, Point&lt;T,M> b)
            {
            	return a+b;
            }
            </code>
            So, in summary, supporting fast generic code that can also operate on IPoint
            requires this odd arrangement of interfaces, and if you want to write such
            generic code then you will need three type parameters (Point, T and M) with
            the following constraints:
            <code>
                where Point : IPointBase&lt;T>, INewPoint&lt;Point, T>
                where M : IMath&lt;T> // or another math interface
            </code>
            It may help to place your methods in a generic class (of Point, T and M) so 
            that you only have to write the constraints once.

            Width as X2 - X1. A bounding rectangle is defined slightly differently:
            the Width is X2 - X1 + e, and the Height is Y2 - Y1 + e, where e is an
            infitessimal value of type T (e=1 if T is an integer type).
            <para/>
            Also, a traditional rectangle is stored as a starting point (X1, Y1)
            and a size (Width, Height), while a bounding rectangle stores X2 and Y2 
            instead, not the Width and Height.
            <para/>
            Finally, this interface could simply represent a pair of points. In 
            that case, Width and Height return the absolute value of X2-X1 and 
            Y2-Y1 respectively.
            <para/>
            A rectangle may or may not require X2 >= X1 and Y2 >= Y1. If X1>X2 or
            Y1>Y2, the rectangle is said to be "not normalized" and the 
            <see cref="!:RectangleExt.IsNormal"/> extension method returns false.

            <remarks>
            This interface can represent one of three types of rectangles: either 
            "normal" rectangles with fundamental variables X, Y, Width, Height, 
            bounding rectangles with two coordinate ranges (X1-X2) and (Y1-Y2), or

            <para/>
            Because of this fact, it is not clear when you modify X1 whether this
            should affect X2 or Width. Similarly, when you modify X2, Y1 or Y2, it
            is not clear whether the size property or the opposite boundary should 
            change. To resolve this question, this interface does not allow you to
            modify the coordinates individually; instead you must change them in 
            pairs: you either set X and Width together, or X1 and X2 together; and
            similarly Y and Height together, or Y1 and Y2 together.
            <para/>
            You can also call the extension methods SetRect() or SetRange() to set
            all four coordinates at once.

            The relationship between Z1, Z2 and Depth, as well as between the

            a starting point plus a size, or a bounding rectangle or a pair of 
            points. Either the object stores a starting point (X1, Y1, Z1) and

            ending point (X2, Y2, Z2).

            Conventionally, when using the size representation, the Width is

            A bounding rectangle is defined slightly differently: the Width is 
            X2 - X1 + e, the Height is Y2 - Y1 + e, and the Depth is Z2 - Z1 + e,

            <remarks>
            In addition to standard tests (which return void), the MiniTest runner
            is planned to support [Test] methods with other return values:
            <ul>
            <li>A test can return a string, which describes the result of the test.</li>
            <li>A test can return an Action (or any other delegate that takes no 
            arguments), which is treated as a sub-test and executed. Sub-tests are 
            run without set-up or tear-down steps.</li>
            <li>A test can return an object that does not implement IEnumerable, which 
            the test runner will assume is a test fixture. The object will be scanned
            for test methods to execute.</li>
            <li>A test can return an object that implements IEnumerable, which the 
            test runner will scan to find tests and test fixtures to execute.</li>
            <li>A test can return a KeyValuePair(TKey, TValue) or DictionaryEntry.
            In that case pair's Value is processed as though it were the return value,
            and the key is a status message.</li>
            </ul>
            These features give the MiniTest runner powerful capabilities while keeping
            it simple. However, please note that NUnit doesn't offer this feature.
            <para/>
            MiniTest allows tests to be static methods if they are inside a test 
            fixture. However, when test objects are returned from a [Test] method, 
            they are not scanned for static methods.
            <para/>
            If multiple tests return the same test fixture instance, directly or 
            indirectly, MiniTest runner will avoid running the test fixture instance 
            multiple times, but it can show the results at multiple places in the 
            result tree, which can be used to construct multiple "views" of the test 
            results.  However, if a test fixture is nested within itself, the nested
            instance is excluded from the result tree.
            <para/>
            If a TestFixture class contains only a single "test suite" method (a
            method that returns tests), MiniTest merges that method with the class in 
            the tree view. For example, if the class "MyTests" has a single method 
            "GetTests", the tree view will use one line for "MyTests.GetTests" rather 
            than separating out GetTests as a child of MyTests.

            provides a <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IBRange`1"/> of 21-bit UCS-4 characters. "U" stands for 
            "Unicode", as in UCS-4, as opposed to a normal string that is UTF-16.</summary>
            <remarks>
            UString is a slice type: it represents either an entire string, or a region
            of characters in a string. .NET strings are converted implicitly to UString.
            <para/>
            It has been suggested that Java and .NET's reliance on 16-bit "unicode" 
            characters was a mistake, because it turned out that 16 bits was not enough 
            to represent all the world's characters.
            <para/>
            Instead it has been suggested that we should use <a href="http://www.utf8everywhere.org/">
            UTF-8 everywhere</a>. To scan UTF-8 data instead of UTF-16 while still 
            supporting non-English characters (or "ĉĥáràĉtérŝ", as I like to say),
            it is useful to have a bidirectional iterator that scans characters one
            codepoint at a time. UString provides that functionality for .NET, and
            the nice thing about UString is that it's portable to UTF-8 environments.
            That is, by using UString, your code is portable to a UTF-8 environment
            that uses an equivalent implementation of UString for UTF-8. Eventually 
            I want Loyc to target native environments, where UTF-8 is common, and 
            UString can provide a common data type for both UTF-8 and UTF-16 
            environments.
            <para/>
            UString is a bidirectional range of "uchar", which is an alias for int
            (uchar means "Unicode" or "UCS-4", rather than "unsigned").
            <para/>
            The difference between StringSlice and UString is that StringSlice is a
            random-access range of char, while UString is a bidirectional range of
            uchar (int). Since UString implements <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IListSource`1"/>,
            it requires <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.StringSlice"/> in order to support the Slice method.
            <para/>
            UString has a <see cref="M:Loyc.UString.DecodeAt(System.Int32)"/> method that tries to decode
            a UTF character to UCS at a particular index.
            <para/>
            Since UString and StringSlice are just slightly different views of the 
            same data, you can implicitly cast between them.
            <para/>
            Unfortunately, it's not possible for UString to compare equal to its 
            equivalent string, for two reasons: (1) System.String.Equals cannot be
            changed, and (2) UString.GetHashCode cannot return the same value as
            String.GetHashCode without actually generating a String object, which
            would be inefficient (String.GetHashCode cannot be emulated because it
            changes between versions of the .NET framework and even between 32- and 
            64-bit builds.)

            A wrapper around <see cref="T:System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch"/> with a more convenient interface,
            currently oriented around measuring milliseconds 
            (TODO: increase similarity to <c>Stopwatch</c>)
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            EzStopwatch is a wrapper around the normal <see cref="T:System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch"/> that
            is less clumsy to use: you can get the elapsed time and restart the 
            timer from zero with a single call to Restart(). The Stopwatch class
            (prior to .NET 4, anyway) requires you to make three separate method 
            calls to do the same thing: you have to call ElapsedMilliseconds, then 
            Reset(), then Start().
            <para/>
            Unlike <see cref="!:Loyc.Utilities.SimpleTimer"/>, this class does not start 
            timing when it is created, which allows it to be a struct without a 
            constructor.
            <para/>
            EzStopwatch behaves differently from Stopwatch when restarting, because I
            observed a problem using the timer to measure short time intervals. I ran
            trials of three operations in a loop, and the loop was programmed to run 
            until the total elapsed time for one of the operations exceeded 100 ms. On 
            each iteration I restarted the timer three times because there were three 
            operations to measure, and when I replaced <see cref="!:SimpleTimer"/> with 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.EzStopwatch"/> for greater accuracy, the loop ran forever! The
            problem was that (depending on the benchmark's input parameters) the 
            operation could take less than 1 millisecond to complete, so 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.EzStopwatch.Millisec"/> always returned zero, and the total never reached
            100.
            <para/>
            To solve this problem, when you "<see cref="M:Loyc.EzStopwatch.Restart"/>" the timer, it is
            not completely reset to zero, but rather the current value of Millisec is
            subtracted from the timer. This leaves a fractional amount of time less
            than 1 millisecond in the timer, so that if you take two measurements 
            that each take 0.6 milliseconds, Millisec will return 0 the first time
            and 1 the second time, leaving 0.2 milliseconds on the clock.
            <para/>
            TODO: change interfaces of SimpleTimer and EzStopwatch to better resemble
            Stopwatch, even though the behavior of "Pause" and "Resume" is more obvious
            than "Stop" and "Start".

            Note: when rethrowing an exception that was just caught, you
            should always use "catch;" instead of calling this method.

            <summary>A general-purpose interface for a class that accepts formatted 
            messages with context information.</summary>
            <remarks>
            IMessageSink is used for dependency injection of a target for formatted 
            messages; it could be used for log messages, compiler error messages, or
            to report the progress of a process, for instance.
            <para/>
            It is typical to use <see cref="T:Loyc.IMessageSink"/> without type parameters.
            <para/>
            Since .NET does not allow static members in an interface, the static
            members can be found in <see cref="T:Loyc.MessageSink"/>.
            <para/>
            Each message has a <see cref="T:Loyc.Severity"/>. For message sinks that are used 
            as loggers, this should be one of the following logging levels, listed
            in order of importance: Fatal, Error, Warning, Note, Debug, Verbose.
            <para/>
            For message sinks that are used for compiler messages, the standard
            levels are: Fatal, Error, Warning, Note, Detail. "Detail" provides more 
            information about a previously-printed message, while "Note" is intended 
            for independent messages that are less severe than warnings (e.g. lints).
            Some compilers may distiguish "soft" errors (which do not prevent the
            program from starting) from "critical" errors (which do). In that case, 
            Error may represent such a "soft" error and Critical may represent a
            "hard" error. Fatal, in contrast, represents an error that causes the
            compiler to halt immediately.
            <para/>
            The message sink itself should perform localization, which can be done
            with <see cref="M:Loyc.Localize.Localized(Loyc.Symbol,System.String,System.Object[])"/>.
            <para/>
            Only a single Write() method is truly needed (<see cref="!:Write(Severity, object, string, object[])"/>),
            but for efficiency reasons the interface contains two other writers. It 
            is expected to be fairly common that a message sink will drop some or
            all messages without printing them, e.g. if a message sink is used for 
            logging, verbose messages might be "off" by default. It would be 
            wasteful to actually localize and format a message if the message will
            not actually be printed, and it would also be wasteful to create an array 
            of objects to hold the arguments if they are just going to be discarded.
            With that in mind, since most formatting requests only need a couple of 
            arguments, there is an overload of Write() that accepts up to two
            arguments without the need to package them into an array, and there is
            an overload that takes no formatting arguments (this indicates that 
            parameter substitution is not required and should not be attempted.)
            <para/>
            In addition, the caller can call <see cref="M:Loyc.IMessageSink`1.IsEnabled(Loyc.Severity)"/> to avoid 
            doing any work required to prepare a message for printing when a certain
            category of output is disabled.

            to which the message is related (for example, when writing compiler 
            output, the context might be a node in a syntax tree). Most message 
            sinks display the message in text form (in a log file or terminal), and 
            in that case the best option is to display the location information 
            associated with the context object (e.g. Foo.cpp:45), rather than a 
            string representation of the object itself.
            <para/>
            Therefore, message sinks that display a message in text form will call
            this method to convert the context object to a string, and if available,
            this method calls the <see cref="P:Loyc.IHasLocation.Location"/>

            <summary>Adds extension methods to modernize .NET's simple built-in service locator.</summary>
            <remarks>
            .NET has had a litte-known built-in simple service locator since .NET 1.1 called
            <see cref="T:System.ComponentModel.Design.ServiceContainer"/>, which implements both 
            <see cref="T:System.ComponentModel.Design.IServiceContainer"/> and <see cref="T:System.IServiceProvider"/>. 
            IServiceContainer lets you add services (associating a Type object with a factory or 
            a singleton):
            <pre>
            interface IServiceContainer {
                void AddService(Type serviceType, object serviceInstance);
                void AddService(Type serviceType, ServiceCreatorCallback callback);
                ...
            }
            delegate object ServiceCreatorCallback(IServiceContainer container, Type serviceType);
            </pre>
            
            Meanwhile, IServiceProvider is a simple service locator:
            <pre>
            public interface IServiceProvider
            {
            	object GetService(Type serviceType);
            }
            </pre>
            
            This class adds three extension methods to make IServiceContainer and IServiceProvider 
            generic, so you can write code like
            <pre>
               var services = new ServiceContainer();
               services.AddService&lt;IFoo>(p => new Foo());
               
               // elsewhere in your code...
               IFoo newFoo = services.GetService&lt;IFoo>();
            </pre>
            
            Remember that service locators are generally an antipattern! However, if you have one
            of those rare, legitimate needs to use one, you should prefer the IServiceProvider 
            interface built into .NET (if it is enough for your needs) so that your lower-level 
            code avoids taking an unnecessary dependency on an IoC framework.

        <member name="T:Loyc.Localize">
            <summary>
            Localize is a global hook into which a string-mapping localizer can be
            installed. It is designed to make internationalization exceptionally easy
            for developers. TODO: expand I18N features based on Mozilla's L20N.
            </summary><remarks>
            All Loyc code should call this hook in order to localize text (although
            as of June 2015, no one has made any translation tables). Use it like
            this:
            <code>
            string result = "Hello, {0}".Localized(userName);
            </code>
            If no localizer is installed, the format string is left unchanged.
            <para/>
            Whatever localizer is installed will look up the text in its database and
            return a translation. If no translation to the end user's language is
            available, an appropriate default translation should be returned: either the
            original text, or a translation to some default language, e.g. English.
            <para/>
            Alternately, assuming you have the ability to change the table of
            translations, you can use a Symbol in your code and call the other overload
            of Localize() to look up the text that should be shown to the end user:
            <code>
            string result = ((Symbol)"MY_STRING").Localized();
            string result = @@MY_STRING.Localized();  // Enhanced C# with #useSymbols
            </code>
            This is most useful for long strings or paragraphs of text, but I expect
            that some projects, as a policy, will use symbols for all localizable text.
            <p/>
            Localize.Formatter() is then called to make the completed string, unless the
            variable argument list is empty. It is possible to perform formatting
            separately, for example:
            <code>
            Console.WriteLine("{0} is {0:X} in hexadecimal".Localized(), N);
            </code>
            Here, writeline performs the formatting instead. However, Localize's
            default formatter, StringExt.FormatCore, has an extra feature that the 
            standard formatter does not: named arguments. Here is an example:
            <code>
            ...
            string verb = (IsFileLoaded ? "parse" : "load").Localized();
            MessageBox.Show(
                "Not enough memory to {load/parse} '{filename}'.".Localized(
                  {Message}", "load/parse", verb, "filename", FileName));
            }
            </code>
            As you can see, named arguments are mentioned in the format string by
            specifying an argument name such as {filename} instead of a number like
            {0}. The variable argument list contains the same name followed by its
            value, e.g. "filename", FileName. This feature gives you, the developer,
            the opportunity to indicate to the translator person what a particular 
            argument is for.
            <p/>
            The translator must not change any of the arguments: the word "{filename}"
            is not to be translated.
            <p/>
            At run-time, the format string with named arguments is converted to a
            "normal" format string with numbered arguments. The above example would
            become "Could not {1} the file: {3}" and then be passed to string.Format.
            
            <h3>Design rationale</h3>
            
            Many developers don't want to spend time writing internationalization or
            localization code, and are tempted to write code that is only for one
            language. It's no wonder, because it's a relative pain in the neck.
            Microsoft suggests that code carry around a "ResourceManager" object and
            directly request strings from it:
            <code>
            private ResourceManager rm;
            rm = new ResourceManager("MyStrings", this.GetType().Assembly);
            Console.Writeline(rm.GetString("HEXER"), N);
            </code>
            This approach has drawbacks:
            * It may be cumbersome to pass around a ResourceManager instance between all
              classes that might contain localizable strings; a global facility is
              much more convenient.
            * The programmer has to put all translations in the resource file;
              consequently, writing the code is bothersome because the programmer has
              to switch to the resource file and add the string to it. Someone reading
              the code, in turn, can't tell what the string says and has to load up
              the resource file to find out.
            * It is nontrivial to change the localization manager; for instance, what if
              someone wants to store translations in an .ini, .xml or .les file rather 
              than inside the assembly? What if the user wants to centralize all
              translations for a set of assemblies, rather than having separate
              resources in each assembly? 
            * Keeping in mind that the guy in charge of translation is typically
              different than the guys writing most of the code, it makes sense to keep
              translations separate from everything else.
            <p/>
            The idea of the Localize facility is to convince programmers to support
            localization by making it dead-easy to do. By default it is not connected to
            any translator (it just passes strings through), so people who are only
            writing a program for a one-language market can easily make their code
            "multiligual-ready" without doing any extra work, since `.Localized()` is
            no harder to type than `string.Format()`.
            <p/>
            The translation system itself is separate, and connected to `Localized` by a
            delegate, for two reasons:
            <ol>
            <li>Multiple translation systems are possible. This class should be suitable
                for any .NET program, and some programs using this utility will want to
                plug-in a different localizer. </li>
            <li>I personally don't have the time or expertise to write a localizer at 
                this time. So until I do, the Localize class will make my code ready for 
                translation, although not actually localized.</li>
            </ol>
            In the open source world, most developers don't have a team of translators
            ready make translations for them. The idea of Loyc, for example, is that
            many different individuals--not one big team--of programmers will create
            and maintain features. By centralizing this translation facility, it should
            be straightforward for a single multilingual individual to translate the
            text of many modules made by many different people.
            <p/>
            To facilitate this, I propose that in addition to a translator, a program
            should be made to figure out all the strings/symbols for which translations 
            are needed. To do this it would scan source code (at compile time) for 
            calls to methods in this class and generate a list of strings and symbols 
            needing translation. It would also have to detect certain calls that
            perform translation implicity, such as IMessageSink.Write(). See
            <see cref="T:Loyc.LocalizableAttribute"/>.

            <summary>
            This formatter works like string.Format, except that named 
            placeholders accepted as well as numeric placeholders. This method
            replaces named placeholders with numbers, then calls string.Format.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Named placeholders are useful for communicating information about a
            placeholder to a human translator. Here is an example:
            <code>
            Not enough memory to {load/parse} '{filename}'.
            </code>
            In some cases a translator might have difficulty translating a phrase
            without knowing what a numeric placeholder ({0} or {1}) refers to, so 
            a named placeholder can provide an important clue. The localization  
            system is invoked as follows:
            <code>
            string msg = "{man's name} meets {woman's name}.".Localized(
            	"man's name", mansName, "woman's name", womansName);
            </code>
            The placeholder names are not case sensitive.
            
            You can use numeric placeholders, alignment and formatting codes also:
            <code>
            string msg = "You need to run {dist,6:###.00} km to reach {0}".Localized(
            	cityName, "dist", 2.9);
            </code>
            It is assumed that the placeholder name ends at the first comma or colon; 
            hence the placeholder in this example is called "dist", not "dist,6:###.00".
            <para/>
            Typically, the named arguments are expected to start at index N+1 in the 
            variable argument array, where {N} is the largest numeric placeholder, and 
            if there are no numeric placeholders then the named arguments should begin 
            at index 0. In this example there is a {0}, so the named arguments should
            start at index 1. However, since named arguments always come in pairs, an 
            extra rule increments the N if the number of remaining arguments starting
            at N is not an even number. For example, in
            <code>
            string msg = "Hello {0}, you'll go to {school name} next year.".Localized(
            	firstName, lastName, "school name", schoolName);
            </code>
            There are three args left after the numeric ones, so the first remaining
            argument is ignored to make it an even number.
            <para/>
            If a placeholder name is not found in the argument list then it is not
            replaced with a number before the call to string.Format, so a 
            FormatException will occur.

            <summary>Represents a symbol, which is a singleton string that supports fast

            <remarks>
            Call GSymbol.Get() to create a Symbol from a string, or GSymbol.GetIfExists()
            to find a Symbol that has already been created.
            <para/>
            Symbols can be used like a global, extensible enumeration. Comparing symbols
            is as fast as comparing two integers; this is because '==' is not
            overloaded--equality is defined as reference equality, as there is only one
            instance of a given Symbol.
            <para/>
            Symbols can also be produced in namespaces called "pools". Two Symbols with
            the same name, but in different pools, are considered to be different
            symbols. Using a derived class D of Symbol and a SymbolPool&lt;D&gt;,
            you can make Symbols that are as type-safe as enums.
            <para/>
            A Symbol's ToString() function formerly returned the symbol name prefixed 
            with a colon (:), following the convention of the Ruby language, from which 
            I got the idea of Symbols in the first place. However, since Symbols are 
            commonly used for extensible enums, I decided it was better that ToString()
            return just the Name alone, which makes Symbol more suitable as a drop-in 
            replacement for enums.
            <para/>
            Symbols are also useful in compilers and Loyc trees, where there may be a 
            performance advantage in comparing identifiers by reference rather than
            character-by-character.

            There is one global symbol pool (<c>GSymbol.Pool</c>) and you can create an 
            unlimited number of private pools, each with an independent namespace.
            <para/>
            Methods of this class are synchronized, so a SymbolPool can be used from
            multiple threads.
            <para/>
            By default, SymbolPool uses weak references to refer to Symbols, so they 
            can be garbage-collected when no longer in use. When creating a private 
            pool you can tell the SymbolPool constructor to use strong references 
            instead, which ensures that none of the symbols disappear, but risks a 
            memory leak if the pool itself is never garbage-collected. Strong 
            references also require less memory and may be slightly faster.
            <para/>
            By default, all Symbol are given non-negative IDs. GSymbol.Empty (whose 
            Name is "") has an Id of 0, but in a private pool, "" is not treated 
            differently than any other symbol so a new ID will be allocated for it.

            <summary><c>@void.Value</c> represents the sole value of <c>System.Void</c>
            (called "void" in C#).</summary>
            <remarks>.NET unfortunately treats void as something that is not a real 
            type; for example you cannot use <c>new void()</c> or <c>default(void)</c>
            in C#. This was a dumb decision because it means that some generic code
            must be duplicated for void and non-void types. A good example is the fact
            that when you have a <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2"/>, TVal cannot be 
            void, so you cannot use <c>Dictionary(string,void)</c> to express the idea 
            of "a set of strings with no associated values". The <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1"/> 
            class uses a completely separate implementation and cannot just be an
            alias for <c>Dictionary{T,void}</c> (actually they could share 
            implementations using a dummy type like this one, but unfortunately .NET
            made another dumb decision that all types must consume at least one byte,
            so <c>HashSet</c> sharing code with <c>Dictionary</c> would make 
            <c>HashSet</c> less efficient.)
            <para/>
            Defining a @void type allows you to use it when it makes conceptual sense,
            although we cannot avoid .NET's requirement to waste at least one byte.

        <member name="T:Loyc.NoValue">
            <summary><c>NoValue.Value</c> is meant to be used as the value of a 
            property that has "no value", meaning no value is assigned or that the 
            property is meaningless at the current time or in the current context.
            </summary><remarks>
            Most often <c>null</c> is used for this purpose; <c>NoValue.Value</c> 
            is used when <c>null</c> is a considered to be a valid, meaningful 
            value and you want to distinguish between "no value" and "null".
            For example, this is used by the the <see cref="!:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Value"/>
            class, in which <c>NoValue</c> has a different meaning than both 
            <c>null</c> and <c>void</c>.
            <para/>
            Also, this value converts implicitly to <see cref="P:Loyc.Maybe`1.NoValue"/>.
