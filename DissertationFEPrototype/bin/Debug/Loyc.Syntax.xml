            <remarks>This method recognizes LES and EC#-style string syntax.
            Firstly, it recognizes triple-quoted strings (''' """ ```). These 
            strings enjoy special newline handling: the newline is always 
            interpreted as \n regardless of the actual kind of newline (\r and 
            \r\n newlines come out as \n), and indentation following the newline
            can be stripped out. Triple-quoted strings can have escape sequences
            that use both kinds of slash, like so: <c>\n/ \r/ \'/ \"/ \0/</c>.
            However, there are no unicode escapes (\u1234/ is NOT supported).
            <para/>
            Secondly, it recognizes normal strings (' " `). These strings stop 
            parsing (with an error) at a newline, and can contain C-style escape 
            sequences: <c>\n \r \' \" \0</c> etc. C#-style verbatim strings are 
            NOT supported.

             <remarks>
             In LES, the precedence of an operator is decided based simply on the text 
             of the operator. The precedence of each one-character operator is 
             predefined; the precedence of any operator with two or more characters 
             is decided based on the first and last characters (according to
             the rules below). Other characters, if any, do not affect precedence.
             <para/>
             The LES precedence table mostly matches popular programming languages,
             i.e. those in the C family.
             <para/>
             An operator consists of a sequence of the following characters:
             <pre>
                ~ ! % ^ * - + = | &lt; > / ? : . &amp;
             </pre>
             In addition, the $ character is allowed as the first character and, if
             present, it forces the operator to be interpreted as a prefix operator.
             <para/>
             LESv3 also has operators that start with a single quote, which can include
             both letters and punctuation (e.g. <c>'|foo|</c>). The quote itself is 
             ignored for the purpose of choosing precedence. LESv2 has <c>`backquoted`</c> 
             operators instead, whereas in LESv3 backquoted strings are simply 
             identifiers. 
             <para/>
             It is notable that the following punctuation cannot be used in operators:
             <ul>
             <li>"@" is used for multiple other purposes.</li>
             <li>"#" is conventionally used to mark "keywords" (although in LESv2, the 
             parser treats it like an underscore or a letter.)</li>
             <li>"," and ";" are separators, so for example, "?,!" is parsed as three 
             separate tokens.</li>
             <li>The backslash "\" is reserved for future use.</li>
             </ul>
             <para/>
             The following table shows all the precedence levels and associativities
             of the "built-in" LES operators, except a couple of special operators such
             as the "lambda" operator =>, whose precedence is different on the left side 
             than on the right side. Each precedence level has a name, which corresponds 
             to a static field of this class. All binary operators are left-associative 
             unless otherwise specified.

             non-lowercase keywords.
             <para/>
             Notice that the precedence of an operator depends on how it is used. The 
             prefix operator <c>-</c> has higher precedence than the binary operator 
             <c>-</c>, so for example <c>- y * z</c> is parsed as <c>(- y) * z</c>, 
             while <c>x - y * z</c> is parsed as <c>x - (y * z)</c>.
             <para/>
             Programmers often use the shift operators <c>>></c> and <c>&lt;&lt;</c> 
             in place of multiplication or division, so their <i>natural</i> precedence
             is the same as <c>*</c> and <c>/</c>. However, traditionally the C
             family of languages confusingly give the shift operators a precedence 
             below <c>+</c>. Therefore, LES does not allow mixing of shift operators
             with <c>+ - * /</c>; <c>a >> b + c</c> should produce a parse error.
             This is called immiscibility as explained in the documentation of 
             <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence"/>. Parsing may still complete, but the exact 
             output tree is unspecified (may be <c>(a >> b) + c</c> or 
             <c>a >> (b + c)</c>).
             <para/>
             Likewise, the bitwise <c>^ | &amp;</c> operators cannot be mixed with
             comparison operators as in <c>a | 1 == 3</c>.
             <para/>
             The Lambda operator =>, which is right-associative, has a precedence 
             level above Multiply on the left side, but below Assign on the right 
             side. For example, the expression <c>a = b => c = d</c> is parsed as 
             <c>a = (b => (c = d))</c>, and similarly <c>a + b => c + d</c> is parsed 
             as <c>a + (b => (c + d))</c>, but <c>a ** b => c ** d</c> is parsed
             <c>(a ** b) => (c ** d)</c>. The idea of two different precedences on the
             two sides of an operator may seem strange; see the documentation of 
             <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence"/> for more explanation.
             <para/>
             Similarly, all assignment operators (including compound assignments like
             +=) have a high precedence on the left side and low precedence on the 
             right. This decision was made for WebAssembly, in which an expression like
             <c>2 * i32_store[$f(),4] = 3 * $g()</c> is best parsed as 
             <c>2 * (i32_store[$f(),4] = (3 * $g()))</c> (NOTE: this example will 
             surely be wrong by the time Wasm is released).
             <para/>
             As a nod to functional languages, the arrow operator "->" is right-
             associative and has a precedence below '*' so that <c>int * int -> int</c>
             parses as <c>(int * int) -> int</c> rather than <c>int * (int -> int)</c> 
             as in the C family of languages.
             <para/>
             Some operators like <c>'this-one</c> do not begin with punctuation. These
             "keyword operators" must be used as binary operators. They either start
             with a lowercase letter or they don't. If they do start with a lowercase
             letter, their precedence is LowerKeyword, which is very low, below 
             assignment, so that <c>a = b 'then x = y</c> parses like 
             <c>(a = b) 'then (x = y)</c>.
             <para/>
             If they do not start with a lowercase letter (as in <c>'Foo</c> or 
             <c>'123</c>) then they have an indeterminate precedence, below power
             (**) but above comparison (==). This means that an operator like 'XOR
             or 'Mod cannot be mixed with operators of precedence Multiply, Add, 
             Arrow, AndBits, OrBits, OrIfNull, PrefixDots, and Range operators.
             Mixing operators illegally (e.g. <c>x 'Mod y + z</c>) will produce a 
             parse error.
             <para/>
             After constructing an initial table based on common operators from other
             languages, I noticed that 
             <ul>
             <li>None of the high-precedence operators were right-associative, so I 
             added the !! operator to "fill in the gap".</li>
             <li>There were no prefix operators with low precedence, so I added ".." 
             whose precedence is just above binary "..", and "|" which has a precedence 
             lower than anything except attributes (this "operator" is inspired by
             Nemerle, which uses "|" in pattern matching and variants.)</li>
             </ul>
             I also wanted to have a little "room to grow"--to defer the precedence 
             decision to a future time for some operators. So the precedence of the 
             binary operator ~ has a range of operators with which it cannot be
             mixed, the same range as for uppercase operators without punctuation;
             for example, <c>x ~ y + z</c> is invalid but <c>x ~ y == z</c> is allowed.
             <para/>
             The operators <c>\ ? = > &lt;</c> cannot be used as prefix operators.
             <para/>
             The way that low-precedence prefix operators are parsed deserves some 
             discussion... TODO.
             <para/>
             Most operators can have two roles. Most operators can either be 
             binary operators or prefix operators; for example, <c>!*!</c> is a 
             binary operator in <c>x !*! y</c> but a prefix operator in <c>x + !*! y</c>.
             <para/>
             The operators <c>++ --</c> also have two roles, but different roles: 
             they can be either prefix or suffix operators, but not binary operators.
             For example, <c>-*-</c> is a suffix operator in <c>x -*- + y</c> and a 
             prefix operator in <c>x + -*- y</c>. Please note that <c>x -*- y</c> is 
             ambiguous (it could be parsed as either of two superexpressions, 
             <c>(x -*-) (y)</c> or <c>(x) (-*- y)</c>) and it is illegal.
             <para/>
             Operators that start with $ can only be prefix operators (not binary or 
             suffix). Having only a single role makes these operators unambiguous 
             inside superexpressions (LESv2) or with juxtaposition (LESv3).
             <para/>
             An operator cannot have all three roles (suffix, prefix and binary); that 
             would be overly ambiguous. For example, if "-" could also be a suffix 
             operator then <c>x - + y</c> could be parsed as <c>(x -) + y</c> as well 
             as <c>x - (+ y)</c>. More subtly, LES does not define any operators that
             could take binary or suffix roles, because that would also be ambiguous. 
             For example, suppose <c>|?|</c> is a binary or suffix operator, but not a 
             prefix operator. Clearly <c>x |?| y</c> and <c>x |?| |?| y</c> are 
             unambiguous, but <c>x |?| + y</c> is ambiguous: it could be parsed as 
             <c>(x |?|) + y</c> or <c>x |?| (+ y)</c>. It turns out that a computer 
             language can contain operators that serve as binary and prefix operators, 
             OR it can contain operators that serve as binary and suffix operators, 
             but a language is ambiguous if it has both kinds of operators at the 
             same time.
            
             <h3>How to detect an operator's precedence</h3>
             
             To determine the precedence of any given operator, first you must
             decide, mainly based on the context in which the operator appears and the
             text of the operator, whether it is a prefix, binary, or suffix operator. 
             Suffix operators can only be derived from the operators <c>++, --</c>
             ("derived" means that you can add additional operator characters in the 
             middle, e.g. <c>+++</c> and <c>-%-</c> are can be prefix or suffix 
             operators.)
             <para/>
             If an operator starts with a single quote in LESv3 ('), the quote is not
             considered for the purpose of choosing precedence (rather, it is used to 
             allow letters and digits in the operator name).
             <para/>
             Next, if the operator is only one character, simply find it in the list
             of operators in the previous section to learn its precedence. If the 
             operator is two or more characters, take the first character A and the 
             and the last character Z, and of the following rules, use the <b>first</b>
             rule that applies:
             <ol>
             <li>If AZ is "!=" or "==", or if the operator is exactly two characters 
             long (ignoring the initial single quote) and equal to ">=", or "&lt;=",
             its precedence is Compare. This rule separates comparison operators from 
             assignment operators, so that ">>=" is different from ">=", and "===" 
             counts as a comparison operator.</li>
             <li>If it's an infix operator and Z is '=', the precedence is Assign.</li>
             <li>Look for an operator named AZ from the section above. If it is defined,
             the operator will have the same precedence. For example, binary <c>=|></c>
             has the same precedence as binary "=>".</li>
             <li>Otherwise, look for an entry in the table for A. For example,
             binary "%+" has the same precedence as binary "%" and unary "-*" has
             the same precedence as unary "-".</li>
             <li>If the operator is not an infix operator, it is illegal
             (e.g. prefix ?? doesn't exist).</li>
             <li>If A is a lowercase letter, the precedence is LowerKeyword.</li>
             <li>Otherwise, the operator's precedence is Other.</li>
             </ol>
             The double-colon :: has the "wrong" precedence according to C# and C++
             rules; <c>a.b::c.d</c> is parsed <c>(a.b)::(c.d)</c> although it would 
             be parsed <c>((a.b)::c).d</c> in C# and C++. The change in precedence 
             allows double colon to be used for variable declarations in LeMP, as 
             in <c>x::System.Drawing.Point</c>. The lower precedence allows this
             to be parsed properly, but it sacrifices full fidelity with C#/C++.
             <para/>
             There are no ternary operators in LES. '?' and ':' are right-associative 
             binary operators, so <c>c ? a : b</c> is parsed as <c>c ? (a : b)</c>.
             The lack of an official ternary operator reduces the complexity of the
             parser.
             <para/>
             LES represents Loyc trees, which do not distinguish operators and 
             functions except by name; <c>x += y</c> is equivalent to the function 
             call <c>`'+=`(x, y)</c> in LESv3 (<c>@'+=(x, y)</c> in LESv2), and 
             the actual name of the function is <c>'+=</c>. Operators that do not
             start with a single quote in LES <b>do</b> start with a single quote
             in the final output (e.g. <c>2 + 2</c> is equivalent to <c>2 '+ 2</c>).
             There is an exception: While prefix ++ and -- are named <c>'++</c> and 
             <c>'--</c>, the suffix versions are named <c>'++suf</c> and 
             <c>'--suf</c> in the output tree. For LESv2 operators surrounded by 
             `backquotes`, the backquotes are not included in the output tree (e.g.
             <c>`sqrt` x</c> is equivalent to <c>sqrt(x)</c>).

            <para/>
            This class is abstract because it doesn't know how to classify or create 
            tokens. The derived class must implement <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator`1.GetTokenCategory(`0)"/>,

            <para/>
            Creation of indent, dedent, and end-of-line tokens can be suppressed inside 
            brackets, i.e. () [] {}. This is accomplished by recognizing brackets inside
            your implementation of <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator`1.GetTokenCategory(`0)"/>.

            this class; if it is placed afterward, anything between Indent and Dedent
            tokens will be made a child of the Indent token.
            <para/>
            Note: whitespace tokens (<see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator`1.TokenCategory.Whitespace"/>) are passed 
            through and otherwise unprocessed.
            <para/>
            Note: EOL tokens are not generated for empty or comment lines, and are not 
            generated after a generated indent token, although they could be generated 
            after a pre-existing indent token that was already in the token stream, 
            unless that token is categorized as <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator`1.TokenCategory.OpenBracket"/>.

            <remarks>
            Suppose you use an <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator.IndentToken"/> and <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator.DedentToken"/> 
            that are equal to the token types you've chosen for <c>{ braces }</c> (e.g.  
            (<see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TokenKind.LBrace"/> and <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TokenKind.RBrace"/>), the 
            only indent trigger is a colon (:), and you set <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator.EolToken"/> to 
            the token type you're using for semicolons. Then the token stream from 
            input such as
            <code>
            def Sqrt(value):
            	if value == 0: return 0
            	g = 0; bshft = Log2Floor(value) >> 1;
            	b = 1 &lt;&lt; bshft
            	do:
            		temp = (g + g + b) &lt;&lt; bshft
            		if value >= temp: g += b
            			value -= temp
            		b >>= 1
            	while (bshft-- > 0)
            	return g
            </code>
            will be converted to a token stream equivalent to
            <code>
            def Sqrt(value): {
            	if value == 0: { return 0;
            	} g = 0; bshft = Log2Floor(value) >> 1;
            	b = 1 &lt;&lt; bshft;
            	do: {
            		temp = (g + g + b) &lt;&lt; bshft
            		if value >= temp: { g += b;
            			value -= temp;
            		} b >>= 1;
            	} while (bshft-- > 0);
            	return g;
            }</code>
            That is, a semicolon is added to lines that don't already have one, open 
            braces are inserted right after colons, and semicolons are <i>not</i> added 
            right after opening braces.
            <para/>
            If multiple indents occur on a single line, as in
            <code>
            if x: if y:
                Foo(x, y)
            </code>
            The output will be like this:
            <code>
            if x: { if y: {
                Foo(x, y);
            }}
            </code>
            
            <h3>Configuration for Python</h3>
            
            Newlines generally represent the end of a statement, while colons mark 
            places where a "child" block is expected. Inside parenthesis, square 
            brackets, or braces, newlines are ignored:
            <code>
            	s = ("this is a pretty long string that I'd like "
            	  + " to continue writing on the next line")
            </code>
            And, inside brackets, indentation is ignored, so this is allowed:
            <code>
            if foo:
            	s = ("this is a pretty long string that I'd like "
            + " to continue writing on the next line")
            	print(s)
            </code>
            Note that if you don't use brackets, Python 3 doesn't try to figure out if 
            you "really" meant to continue a statement on the next line:
            <code>
            	# SyntaxError after '+': invalid syntax
            	s = "this is a pretty long string that I'd like " + 
            		" to continue writing on the next line"
            </code>
            Thus OpenBrackets and CloseBrackets should be <c>( [ {</c> and <c>) ] }</c>, 
            respectively. IndentType and DedentType should be synthetic Indent and 
            Dedent tokens, since curly braces have a different meaning (they define a 
            dictionary).
            <para/>
            In Python, it appears you can't write two "block" statements on one line, 
            as in this example:
            <code>
              if True: if True: print() # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
            </code>
            You're also not allowed to indent the next line if the block statement on
            the current line is followed by another statement:
            <code>
              if True: print('a')
                  print('b') # IndentationError: unexpected indent
            </code>
            But you can switch style in different branches:
            <code>
              if True:
                  print("t")
              else: print("f")
              try: print("t")
              except: 
                  print("e")
            </code>
            Also, although you can normally separate statements with semicolons:
            <code>
              print("hell", end=""); print("o")
            </code>
            You are not allowed to write this:
            <code>
              print("?"); if True: # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
                 print("t")
            </code>
            Considering these three facts, I would say that the colon should be 
            classified as an EOL indent trigger (EolIndentTriggers), and the parser 
            should 
            1. recognize non-block statements separately from block statements,
            2. expect a colon to be followed by either an indented block or a non-block 
               statement, but
            3. recognize a non-block "statement" as a <i>list</i> of statements 
               separated by semicolons, with an optional semicolon at the end.
            <para/>
            Now, Python doesn't allow a block statement without a <c>pass</c>, e.g.:
            <code>
              if cond: # "do nothing"
              return   # IndentationError: expected an indented block
            </code>
            I'm inclined to treat this as a special case to be detected in the parser.
            And although you can write a semicolon on a line by itself, you can't 
            write any of these lines:
            <code>
              if cond: ;         # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
              print(); ; print() # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
              ; ;                # SyntaxError: invalid syntax
            </code>
            My interpretation is that a semicolon <i>by itself</i> is treated as a block 
            statement (i.e. illegal in a non-block statement context). Since a semicolon
            is not treated the same way as a newline, the <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator.EolToken"/> should 
            be a special token, not a semicolon.

            LLLPG, use <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.LexerSource`1"/> instead. If you want to
            write a lexer that implements <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.ILexer`1"/> (so it is compatible
            with postprocessors like <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.IndentTokenGenerator"/> and 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TokensToTree"/>), use <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseILexer`2"/> as 
            your base class instead.
            <para/>
            This class contains many methods required by LLLPG, such as 
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.NewSet(System.Int32[])"/>, <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.LA(System.Int32)"/>, <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.LA0"/>,

            cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.TryMatch(System.Collections.Generic.HashSet{System.Int32})"/>(...), along with a few properties that are not 
            used by LLLPG that you still might want to have around, such as 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.FileName"/>, <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.CharSource"/> and 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.SourceFile"/>.
            <para/>
            It also implements the caching behavior for which <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.ICharSource"/>
            was created. See the documentation of <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.ICharSource"/> for more
            information.
            <para/>
            All lexers derived from BaseLexer should call <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.AfterNewline"/>
            at the end of their newline rule, in order to increment the current line
            number. Alternately, your lexer can borrow the newline parser built into 
            BaseLexer, which is called <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.Newline"/> and calls 
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.AfterNewline"/> for you. It is possible to have LLLPG treat 
            this method as a rule, and tell LLLPG the meaning of the rule like this:
            <code>
              extern token Newline @{ '\r' '\n'? | '\n' };
              // BaseLexer also defines a Spaces() method, which behaves like this:
              extern token Spaces  @{ (' '|'\t')* }; 
            </code>
            The <c>extern</c> modifier tells LLLPG not to generate code for the
            rule, but the rule must still have a body so that LLLPG can perform 
            prediction.
            <para/>
            By default, errors are handled by throwing <see cref="T:System.FormatException"/>.
            The recommended way to alter this behavior is to change the 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.BaseLexer`1.ErrorSink"/> property. For example, set it to 
            <see cref="F:Loyc.MessageSink.Console"/> to send errors to the console, or
            use <see cref="M:Loyc.MessageSink.FromDelegate(Loyc.WriteMessageFn,System.Func{Loyc.Severity,System.Boolean})"/> to provide a custom handler.

            <remarks>
            When implementing a lexer, the most efficient approach to building the list
            of line breaks is to save the location of each newline as it is encountered 
            while lexing, rather than doing a separate pass over the file just to find 
            line breaks. This class supports this optimization.

            A common token type recommended for Loyc languages that want to use 
            features such as token literals or the <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TokensToTree"/> class.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            For performance reasons, a Token ought to be a structure rather than
            a class. But if Token is a struct, we have a conundrum: how do we support 
            tokens from different languages? We can't use inheritance since structs
            do not support it. When EC# is ready, we could use a single struct plus
            an alias for each language, but of course this structure predates the 
            implementation of EC#.
            <para/>
            Luckily, tokens in most languages are very similar. A four-word structure
            generally suffices:
            <ol>
            <li><see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.TypeInt"/>: each language can use a different set of token types 
            represented by a different <c>enum</c>. All enums can be converted to 
            an integer, so <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token"/> uses Int32 as the token type. In order
            to support DSLs via token literals (e.g. LLLPG is a DSL inside EC#), the
            TypeInt should be based on <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TokenKind"/>.</li>
            <li><see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.Value"/>: this can be any object. For literals, this should 
            be the actual value of the literal, for whitespace it should be 
            <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.WhitespaceTag.Value"/>, etc. See <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.Value"/> for 
            the complete list.</li>
            <li><see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.StartIndex"/>: location in the original source file where 
            the token starts.</li>
            <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.Length"/>: length of the token in the source file (24 bits).</li>
            <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.Style"/>: 8 bits for other information.</li>
            </ol>
            Originally I planned to use <see cref="T:Loyc.Symbol"/> as the common token 
            type, because it is extensible and could nicely represent tokens in all
            languages; unfortunately, Symbol may reduce parsing performance because 
            it cannot be used with the switch opcode (i.e. the switch statement in 
            C#), so I decided to switch to integers instead and to introduce the 
            concept of <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TokenKind"/>, which is derived from 
            <see cref="T:System.Type"/> using <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TokenKind.KindMask"/>.
            Each language should have, in the namespace of that language, an
            extension method <c>public static TokenType Type(this Token t)</c> that 
            converts the TypeInt to the enum type for that language.
            <para/>
            To save space (and because .NET doesn't handle large structures well),
            tokens do not know what source file they came from and cannot convert 
            their location to a line number. For this reason, one should keep a
            reference to the <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.ISourceFile"/> and call <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.IIndexToLine.IndexToLine(System.Int32)"/> 
            to get the source location.
            <para/>
            A generic token also cannot convert itself to a properly-formatted 
            string. The <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.ToString"/> method does allow

            <li>For numbers: the parsed value of the number (e.g. 4 => int, 4L => long, 4.0f => float)</li>
            <li>For identifiers: the parsed name of the identifier, as a Symbol

            <summary>A list of token categories that most programming languages have.</summary>
            <remarks>
            Some Loyc languages will support the concept of a "token literal" which
            is a <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TokenTree"/>, and some DSLs will rely on these token 
            literals for input. However, tokens differ between different languages; 
            for instance the set of operators varies between languages. On the other 
            hand, most languages do have some concept of "an operator" and "an 
            identifier", and the TokenKind reflects this fact.
            <para/>
            When you are using <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token"/> to represent tokens in your language,
            it is recommended to define every value of your "TokenType" enumeration in 
            terms of TokenKind using integer offsets, like this:
            <pre>
            enum MyTokenType {
                EOF         = TokenKind.Spaces,
                Id          = TokenKind.Id,
                IfKeyword   = TokenKind.OtherKeyword,
                ForKeyword  = TokenKind.OtherKeyword + 1,
                LoopKeyword = TokenKind.OtherKeyword + 2,
                ...
                MulOp   = TokenKind.Operator,
                AddOp   = TokenKind.Operator + 1,
                DivOp   = TokenKind.Operator + 2,
                DotOp   = TokenKind.Dot,
                ...
            }
            </pre>
            Using TokenKind is only important if you intend to support DSLs via token
            literals (e.g. LLLPG) in your language.
            <para/>
            A DSL that just needs simple tokens like "strings", "identifiers" and "dots" 
            can write a parser based on values of <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.Kind"/> alone; if 
            it needs certain specific operators or "keywords" that do not have a 
            dedicated TokenKind, such as + and %, it can further check the Value of the 
            token; meanwhile, the host language put a global <see cref="T:Loyc.Symbol"/> 
            in the <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.Token.Value"/> to represent operators, keywords and 
            identifiers.

            <summary>A read-only interface for objects that act as Loyc trees.</summary>
            <remarks>
            To simplify implementations of this interface, there is no separate 
            list of attributes and arguments; ILNode itself acts as a list of child
            nodes. The argument list is numbered from 0 to Max, so the number of 
            arguments is <c>Max + 1</c> (which is what the ArgCount() extension method 
            returns).
            <para/>
            A node with no children must report <c>Min = -1</c> and <c>Max = -2</c>,
            or some extension methods will malfunction.
            <para/>
            You can think of any node <c>N</c> as having a single contiguous list 
            of child nodes indexed from <c>N.Min</c> to <c>N.Max</c>. Items with
            non-negative indexes (e.g. <c>N[0], N[1]</c>) are arguments; <c>N[-1]</c>
            is an alias for <c>Target</c>; and indexes below -1 refer to attributes
            (e.g. <c>N[-2]</c> is the last attribute in the attribute list)
            <para/>
            ArgCount() and AttrCount() are implemented as extension methods; they
            return <c>Max + 1</c> and <c>-Min - 1</c> respectively (note: ArgCount()
            is different from <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.ArgCount"/> in case 
            <c>Kind != LNodeKind.Call</c>: ArgCount() returns -1 in that case while
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.ArgCount"/> reurns zero.
            <para/>
            The IsId(), IsLiteral() and IsCall() extension methods are useful 
            shorthand for testing the <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.ILNode.Kind"/> property.
            <para/>
            The Attrs() and Args() extension methods return slices of this node
            corresponding to the attributes and arguments.
            <para/>

            This version of BaseParserForList has <c>List</c> (a token list) as a 
            generic parameter. Compared to using <c>IList{Token}</c> directly, this 
            can increase performance in case the <c>List</c> is a value type (e.g.

            <typeparam name="Token">Data type of complete tokens in the token list. A 
            token contains the type of a "word" in the program (string, identifier, plus

            characters in the source file. See <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.ISimpleToken`1"/>.

            <c>MatchType</c> cannot be an enum because, strangely, an enum does not

            For a time, #tuple was used for this purpose; the problem is that a
            find-and-replace operation intended to find run-time tuples could 
            accidentally match one of these lists. So I decided to dedicate # 
            for use inside special constructs; its meaning depends on context.

            The name #private may be slightly confusing, since a symbol marked

             Loyc defines only three types of nodes: simple symbols, literals, and calls.
             <ul>
             <li>A <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.IdNode"/> is a simple identifier, such as a VariableName</li>
             <li>A <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.LiteralNode"/> is a literal constant, such as 123 or "hello"</li>
             <li>A <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.CallNode"/> encompasses all other kinds of nodes, such as
             normal function calls like <c>f(x)</c>, generic specifications like <c>f&lt;x></c>
             (represented as <c>#of(f, x)</c>), braced blocks of statements (represented as
             <c>@`{}`(stmt1, stmt2, ...)</c>), and so on. Also, parenthesized expressions
             are represented as a call with one argument and <c>null</c> as the <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Target"/>.</li>
             </ul>
             This class provides access to all properties of all three types of nodes,
             in order to make this class easier to access from plain C#, and to avoid
             unnecessary downcasting in some cases.

             intermediate representation for back-ends, Loyc nodes are intended to be a 
             universal intermediate representation for syntax trees, and Loyc will 
             (eventually) include a generic set of tools for semantic analysis so that
             it provides a generic representation for front-ends.
             <para/>
             EC#, then, will be the first language to use the Loyc syntax tree 
             representation, known as the "Loyc tree" for short. Most syntax trees are 
             very strongly typed, with separate data types for, say, variable 
             declarations, binary operators, method calls, method declarations, unary 
             operators, and so forth. Loyc, however, defines only three types of Nodes,
             and this one class provides access to all the parts of a node. There are 
             several reasons for this design:
             <ul>
             <li>Simplicity. Many compilers have thousands of lines of code dedicated 
               to the AST (abstract syntax tree) data structure itself, because each 
               kind of AST node has its own class.</li>
             <li>Serializability. Loyc nodes can always be serialized to a plain text 
               "prefix tree" and deserialized back to objects, even by programs that 
               are not designed to handle the language that the tree represents*. This 
               makes it easy to visualize syntax trees or exchange them between 
               programs.</li>
             <li>Extensibility. Loyc nodes can represent any language imaginable, and
               they are suitable for embedded DSLs (domain-specific languages). Since 
               nodes do not enforce a particular structure, they can be used in 
               different ways than originally envisioned. For example, most languages 
               only have "+" as a binary operator, that is, with two arguments. If  
               Loyc had a separate class for each AST, there would probably be a 
               PlusOperator class derived from BinaryOperator, or something, with 
               properties "Left" and "Right". But since there is only one node class, 
               a "+" operator with three arguments is always possible; this is denoted 
               by #+(a, b, c) in EC# source code.</li>
             </ul>
               * Currently, the only supported languages for plain-text Loyc trees are 
                 LES and EC# (either normal EC# or prefix-tree notation).
             <para/>
             Loyc trees are comparable to LISP trees, except that "attributes" and
             position information are added to the tree, and the concept of a "list" 
             is replaced with the concept of a "call", which I feel is a more 
             intuitive notion in most programming languages that are not LISP.
             <para/>
             Loyc's representation is both an blessing and a curse. The advantage is 
             that Loyc nodes can be used for almost any purpose, perhaps even 
             representing data instead of code in some cases. However, there is no 
             guarantee that a given AST follows the structure prescribed by a particular 
             programming language, unless a special validation step is performed after 
             parsing. In this way, Loyc trees are similar to XML trees, only simpler.
             <para/>
             Another major disadvantage is that it is more difficult to interpret a 
             syntax tree correctly: you have to remember that a method definition has 
             the structure <c>#fn(return_type, name, args, body)</c>, so if "node" is 
             a method definition then <c>node.Args[2]</c> represents the argument 
             list, for example. In contrast, most compilers have an AST class called 
             <c>MethodDefinition</c> or something, that provides properties such as 
             Name and ReturnType. If EC# is ever done, however, aliases could help 
             avoid this problem by providing a more friendly veneer over the raw nodes.
             <para/>
             For optimization purposes, the node class is a class hierarchy, but most 
             users should only use this class.
             <para/>
             <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.LNode"/>s are "persistent" in the comp-sci sense, which 
             means that they are immutable, that a subtree can be shared among 
             multiple syntax trees, and that nodes do not know their own parents, 
             which allows a single node to exist at multiple locations in a syntax tree.
             This makes manipulation of trees convenient, as there is no need to 
             "detach" a node from one place, or duplicate it, before it can be inserted 
             in another place.
            
             <h3>The reimplementation</h3>
             
             This implementation has been redesigned (in Subversion, the last version
             based on the old design is revision 289.) The core concept is the same as 
             described in my blog at
             http://loyc-etc.blogspot.ca/2013/04/the-loyc-tree-and-prefix-notation-in-ec.html
             except that the concept of a "Head" has mostly been eliminated, although
             you might see it occasionally because it still has a meaning. The "head"
             of a node refers either to the Name of a symbol, the Value of a literal,
             or the Target of a call (i.e. the name of the method being called, which
             could be an arbitrarily complex node). In the original implementation, it 
             was also possible to have a complex head (a head that is itself a node) 
             even when the node was not a call; this situation was used to represent
             an expression in parenthesis.
             <para/>
             This didn't quite feel right, so I changed it. Now, only calls can be
             "complex", and the head of a call (the method being called) is called 
             the Target.
             <para/>
             In the new version, there are explicitly three types of nodes: symbols, 
             literals, and calls. There is no longer a Head property, instead there 
             are three separate properties for the three kinds of heads, <see 
             cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Name"/> (a Symbol), <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Value"/> (an Object), and <see 
             cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Target"/> (an LNode). Only call nodes have a Target, and only 
             literal nodes have a Value. Identifier nodes have a Name, but I thought 
             it would be useful for some call nodes to also have a Name, which is 
             defined as the name of the Target if the Target is an identifier (if 
             the Target is not a symbol, the call has no name.)
             <para/>
             An expression in parenthesis is now represented by a call with the
             #trivia_inParens attribute; use <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.LNodeExt.IsParenthesizedExpr(Loyc.Syntax.LNode)"/> to 
             detect the parentheses.
             <para/>
             The problems that motivated a redesign are described at
             http://loyc-etc.blogspot.ca/2013/05/redesigning-loyc-tree-code.html
             <para/>
             One very common use of mutable nodes is building lists of statements, e.g. 
             you might create an empty braced block or an empty loop and then add 
             statements to the body of the block or loop. To do this without mutable 
             nodes, create a mutable <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.WList`1"/> instead and add 
             statements there; once the list is finished, create the braced block or
             loop afterward. The new design stores arguments and attributes in 
             <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.VList`1"/> objects; you can instantly convert your WList 
             to a VList by calling <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.WListBase`1.ToVList"/>.
             <para/>
             During the redesign I've decided on some small changes to the representation
             of certain expressions in EC#.
             <ul>
             <li>The '.' operator is now treated more like a normal binary operator; 
                 <c>a.b.c</c> is now represented <c>@.(@.(a, b), c)</c> rather than 
                 <c>@.(a, b, c)</c> mainly because it's easier that way, and because the 
                 second representation doesn't buy anything significant other than a 
                 need for special-casing.</li>
             <li><c>int x = 0</c> will now be represented <c>#var(int, x = 0)</c>
                 rather than <c>#var(int, x(0))</c>. I chose the latter representation 
                 initially because it is slightly more convenient, because you can 
                 always learn the name of the declared variable by calling 
                 <c>var.Args[1].Name</c>. However, I decided that it was more important
                 for the syntax tree to be predictable, with obvious connections between
                 normal and prefix notations. Since I decided that <c>alias X = Y;</c> 
                 was to be represented <c>#alias(X = Y, #())</c>, it made sense for the 
                 syntax tree of a variable declaration to also resemble its C# syntax. 
                 There's another small reason: C++ has both styles <c>Foo x(y)</c> and 
                 <c>Foo x = y</c>; if Loyc were to ever support C++, it would make sense 
                 to use <c>#var(Foo, x(y))</c> and <c>#var(Foo, x = y)</c> for these two 
                 cases, and I believe C#'s variable declarations are semantically closer 
                 to the latter. (Note: another possibility was #var(int, x) = 0, but I 
                 decided this wasn't an improvement, it would just shift the pain around.)</li>
             <li>A constructor argument list is required on <i>all</i> types using the #new
                 operator, e.g. <c>new int[] { x }</c> must have an empty set of arguments
                 on int[], i.e. <c>#new(#of(#[],int)(), x)</c>; this rule makes the 
                 different kinds of new expressions easier to interpret by making them 
                 consistent with each other.</li>
             <li>A missing syntax element is now represented by the empty identifier 
                 instead of the identifier #missing.</li>
             <li>I've decided to adopt the "in-expression" generics syntax from Nemerle 
                 and the binary ! from D as unambiguous alternatives to angle brackets: 
                 List.[int] and List!int mean List&lt;int> and the printer will use 
                 one of these in cases where angle brackets are ambiguous.</li>
             <li>By popular demand, constructors will be written this(...) instead
                 of new(...), since both D and Nemerle use the latter notation.</li>
             <li>The \ and $ characters have been changed; @@S now denotes a symbol S,
                 $S now denotes a substitution, and \S doesn't mean anything.
                 Originally EC# was designed just as an extension of C#, so \ made 
                 sense as a substitution operator for string interpolation because it 
                 doesn't hurt backward compatibility: "Loaded '\(filename)' successfully". 
                 But now that my focus has shifted to multi-language interoperability, 
                 $ makes more sense, as it is used for string interpolation in at least 
                 five other languages and it makes sense to use the same character for 
                 both string substitution and code substitution.</li>
             </ul>
             
             <h3>Important properties</h3>
             
             The main properties of a node are
             <ol>
             <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Attrs"/>: holds the attributes of the node, if any.</li>
             <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Name"/>: the name of an <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.IdNode"/>, or the name 
                of the <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.IdNode"/> that is acting as the <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Target"/> 
                of a <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.CallNode"/>.</li>
             <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Value"/>: the value of a <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.LiteralNode"/>.</li>
             <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Target"/>: the target of a <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.CallNode"/>. It 
                represents a method, macro, or special identifier that is being called.</li>
             <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Args"/>: holds the arguments to a <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.CallNode"/>,
                if any. Returns an empty list if the node does not have an argument list.</li>
             <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Range"/>: indicates the source file that the node came from
                and location in that source file.</li>
             <li><see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Style"/>: an 8-bit flag value that is used as a hint to the
                node printer about how the node should be printed. For example, a hex
                literal like 0x10 has the <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.NodeStyle.Alternate"/> style to
                distinguish it from decimal literals such as 16. Custom display styles 
                that do not fit in the Style property can be expressed with attributes.</li>
             </ol>
             <para/>
             The argument and attribute lists cannot be null, since they have type 
             <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.VList`1"/> which is a struct.
             <para/>
             <c>LNode</c> implements <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.INegListSource`1"/>, so you can loop 
             through all children of the node like this:
             <code>
             for (int i = node.Min; i &lt;= node.Max; i++) {
                 LNode child = node[i];
             }
             </code>
             You can also use <c>foreach</c>. The children are numbered like this:
             <ul>
             <li>if i is less than -1, node[i] refers to an attribute. Specifically, node[i] 
             means node.Attrs[i + node.Attrs.Count + 1] in that case.</li>
             <li>node[-1] refers to <c>Target</c> (but throws if there is no target)</li>
             <li>Non-negative values are indexes of Args, e.g. node[i] means node.Args[i].</li>
             </ul>
             LNode also provides <c>Select(child => result)</c> and <c>ReplaceRecursive(child => result)</c>
             methods which allows you to transform all children (Atrrs, Target and Args).
             Currently there is no <c>Where(child => bool)</c> method because it is not
             possible to remove the <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Target"/> of an LNode (you can still use
             standard LINQ Where(), of course, but the result is not an LNode).
             
             <h3>Note</h3>
             
             The argument and attribute lists should never contain null nodes. Any code 
             that puts nulls in <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Args"/> or <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Attrs"/> is buggy. 
             However, we can't ensure nulls are not placed into <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.VList`1"/> 
             since it's a general-purpose data type, not specialized for LNode. There is
             code to ensure nulls are not placed in Args and Attrs (<see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.NoNulls(Loyc.Collections.VList{Loyc.Syntax.LNode},System.String)"/>),
             but only in debug builds, since null-checking is fairly expensive.

            A parser should record a sufficiently wide range for each parent node, 
            such that all children are fully contained within the range. However, 
            this is not an invariant; macros can splice together syntax trees from 
            different source files or add synthetic nodes, so that the parent range
            does not necessarily include all child ranges. (In fact, in general it 
            is impossible to ensure that parent ranges include child ranges because
            a parent can only specify a single source file, while children can come
            from several source files.)

            calling the <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Trivia(Loyc.Symbol,System.Object,Loyc.Syntax.LNode)"/> function. Since an LNode is not 
            allowed to have both a Name and a Value (as there is no syntax in LES 
            or EC# for such a node), a trivia node pretends that there is an 
            argument list with one item, and that one item is always a literal 
            whose Value is the value stored in the trivia node. Thus, a token node 
            is printed out as <c>TokenType(Value)</c> where <c>Value</c> is some 
            literal.
            <para/>
            If you suspect you're dealing with a trivia node, it is wasteful to 
            actually call <c>node.Args[0].Value</c> since this causes a temporary
            token list to be allocated. Instead you should use this property, which
            returns the token value without allocating memory. Of course, if this 
            property is called on a non-trivia node, it simply returns 
            <c>Args[0].Value</c>.

            <remarks>
            Trailing trivia is represented by a call to #trivia_trailing in a node's 
            attribute list; each argument to #trivia_trailing represents one piece of 
            trivia.
            <para/>
            In the current design, this method has a side-effect of recreating the #trivia_trailing
            node at the end of the attribute list, and if there are multiple #trivia_trailing
            lists, consolidating them into a single list, but only if the specified <c>trivia</c>

            This method supports multi-part captures, which are matched to 
            placeholders whose identifier either (A) has a #params attribute or
            (B) has the unary ".." operator applied to it (for example, if 
            the placeholder is called p, this is written as <c>$(params p)</c> in 
            EC#.) A placeholder that looks like this can match multiple arguments or
            multiple statements in the <c>candidate</c> (or <i>no</i> arguments, or
            no statements), and will become a #splice(...) node in <c>captures</c>
            if it matches multiple items. Multi-part captures are often useful for
            getting lists of statements before and after some required element,
            e.g. <c>{ $(params before); MatchThis($something); $(params after); }</c>
            <para/>
            If the same placeholder appears twice then the two matching items are 
            combined into a single output node (calling #splice).

            Styles may be used in different ways by different parsers, different
            printers and different people. Be careful how you rely on them; they are

            attaching special attributes recognized by the printer for that language.

            <code>
               MessageBox.Show([en] "Hello, World!");
            </code>
            If an attribute is not used by any plug-in, the compiler should print 
            a warning that the attribute is unused. This leads to the question, how
            can a compiler tell if an attribute was ever used? The Handled flag
            is one possible mechanism; when any part of the compiler or its plug-
            ins use an attribute, the Handled flag could be set to disable the
            compiler warning.

            Remember that the same node can theoretically appear in multiple
            places in a syntax tree, which typically happens when a statement or
            expression is duplicated by a macro, without being changed. Remember 
            that when a style is changed on such a node, the change is visible at 
            all locations where the same node is used. However, style flags are
            not synchronized between copies of a node.

            By default, printers add newlines between statements within a braced 
            block. Therefore, this class does not add trivia to mark a single newline 
            between statements; instead, it adds a #trivia_appendStatement attribute 
            when the expected newline prior to a statement in a braced block was NOT 
            present. Also, a newline is expected after a single-line comment and no 
            <c>#trivia_newline</c> is created for the expected newline.
            <para/>
            Finally, since printers typically add a newline before the closing brace by
            default, this class avoids adding an attribute for that newline, if present.

             derived class that knows how to interpret the trivia and associate it with
             a specific <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.LNode"/>, or use the standard derived class 
             <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.StandardTriviaInjector"/>.
             <para/>
             The algorithm is designed to postprocess output from a parser that works in
             a typical way. The lexer for your language needs to follow the following rules:
             
             <ul>
             <li>It must not include the newline character in the range of a single-line 
             comment.</li>
             <li>Generally, newlines (including the newline after a single-line comment)
             must be included in the trivia list, as the algorithm relies on these newlines
             instead of asking <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Range"/> for line numbers, which is
             slower. If newlines are omitted then a comment right after a statement (e.g.
             on the same line) will be associated with the next statement instead.</li>
             </ul>
             
             Typically one will wrap the lexer in <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Lexing.TriviaSaver"/>, which 
             saves trivia while filtering out whitespace so that the parser doesen't see it.
             <para/>
             Your language's parser needs to follow the following rules:
             
             <ul>
             <li>The parser should assign minimal boundaries to each node: the 
             <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Range"/> should not be wider than necessary. If there is 
             a comment before an expression like <c>/*!* / x + y</c>, the parser should 
             not include the comment as part of the range unless it wants the comment to 
             be associated with a child node (<c>x</c>) instead of with the entire 
             expression (<c>x + y</c>).</li>
             <li>If a node has normal (non-trivia) attributes attached to it, the range of
             the node should include those attributes.</li>
             <li>The parser should use <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.LNodeFactory.InParens(Loyc.Syntax.LNode)"/> to place a
             node in parentheses and include the index of the opening and closing parens.</li>
             <li>If an expression/statement is terminated by a semicolon/comma, it's 
             best (but not crucial) to include the semicolon/comma in the LNode.Range, 
             but if a statement is terminated by a newline, the newline should not be 
             included in the range. If general, when the terminator is included in the 
             range, then any comment that appears before the terminator is attached
             to the final child node rather than to the node as a whole. (e.g. in 
             <c>x = y /*y* /;</c>, the comment is associated with <c>y</c> if the
             comment is within the range of the statement as a whole.)</li>
             </ul>
             This example shows how comments are associated with nodes:
             [NOTE: the space in "* /" is a workaround for a serious bug in Doxygen, the html doc generator]
             <pre>
             // Comment attached to block
             {
               // Comment attached to Foo() call
               Foo(
            		// Comment attached to «argument1 + 1». Note that the comma is 
            		// generally invisible to the injector since it is not part of the LNode 
            		// tree, so the 1st and 2nd comments will both be attached to the sum-
            		// expression as a whole.
            		argument1 + 1 /*1st comment* /, // 2nd comment
            		// Comment attached to «argument2 + 2»
            		argument2 + 2); // Comment attached to Foo() call
            	  Area = 3.14159265/*PI* / * /*radius* /r**2;
            	  // Comment attached to «Area =» statement, preceded by newline trivia?
            
            	  // Comment attached to Bar()
            	  @BarAttr // Comment attached to BarAttr attribute
            	  Bar();
            	  
            	  // Comment attached to Bar() because there are no statements afterward
             }
             </pre>
             When there is a single newline between two nodes, <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.AbstractTriviaInjector`1.Run(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator{Loyc.Syntax.LNode})"/> will
             associate it with the second one. When there is a blank line between two 
             nodes (two newlines), the first newline (and any before) is associated with 
             the first node and the second newline (and any following) is associated with 
             the second.

            <summary>A four-byte tuple that represents the precedence and miscibility 
            of an operator.</summary>
            <remarks>
            Precedences encode knowledge like the fact that <c>x &amp; y == z</c> will 
            be parsed as <c>x &amp; (y == z)</c> in C#. An operator's precedence is 
            encoded in the two numbers, <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Left"/> and <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Right"/>.  
            For typical operators which are left-associative, Left and Right are the 
            same. However, some operators have different precedence on the left than 
            on the right, a prime example being the => operator: <c>x = a => y = a</c> 
            is parsed <c>x = (a => (y = a))</c>; it has very high precedence on the 
            left, but very low precedence on the right.
            <para/>
            To understand how this works, remember that a parser scans from left to 
            right. Each time it encounters a new operator, it needs to figure out 
            whether to include that operator in the current (inner) expression or 
            whether to "complete" the inner expression and bind the operator to an
            outer expression instead. The concept of a "precedence floor" can be used 
            to make this decision.
            <para/>
            For example, suppose we start parsing the expression <c>-a.b + c * d + e</c>.
            The parser sees "-" first, which must be a prefix operator since there is 
            no expression on the left. The <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Right"/> precedence of unary 
            '-' is 90 in EC#, so that will be the "precedence floor" to parse the 
            right-hand side. Operators above 90 will be permitted in the right-hand 
            side; operators at 90 or below will not.
            <para/>
            The next token is 'a', which is an expression by itself and doesn't have 
            any precedence, so it becomes the initial right-hand expression of '-'.
            Next we have '.', which has a <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Left"/> precedence of 100, which 
            is above the precedence floor of 90 so it can be bound to 'a'. The 
            precedence floor (PF) is raised to 100, and the next token 'b' is bound to 
            '.'.
            <para/>
            However, the next token '+' (which must be the binary operator rather than 
            the prefix operator, because there is an expression on the left) cannot be 
            accepted with its precedence of 60. Therefore the expression "a.b" is 
            deemed complete, and the PF is lowered back to 90. Again 60 is less than 
            90, so the expression "-a.b" is also deemed complete and the PF drops to 
            int.MinValue. This expression becomes the left-hand side of the '+' 
            operator. The PF rises to 60, and "c * d" becomes a subexpression because
            the precedence of '*' is 70 > 60. However, next we have '+' with 
            precedence 60, which is not above the PF of 60. Therefore, the 
            subexpression "c * d" is deemed complete and the PF lowers to int.MinValue
            again. Now the '+' can be accepted with a left-hand side of <c>(-(a.b)) + 
            (c * d)</c>, and the right-hand side is, of course, 'e', so the completed
            expression is <c>((-(a.b)) + (c * d)) + e</c>. Hope that helps!
            <para/>
            Notice that <c>a + b + c</c> is parsed <c>(a + b) + c</c>, not 
            <c>a + (b + c)</c>. This is the natural result when the operator's 
            precedence is the same on the left and on the right. However, <c>a = b = c</c>
            is parsed <c>a = (b = c)</c>, because its precedence is 1 on the left and 
            0 on the right. When the parser sees the first '=' it sets the PF to 0 
            because it is about to parse the right side. When it encounters the second 
            '=', the precedence of the Left side of that operator is 1 which is higher 
            than the current PF (0) so it is included in the right-hand side of the 
            first '='. This behavior is called "right associativity"; 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.IsRightAssociative"/> returns true when <c>Left > Right</c>.
            <para/>
            Prefix and suffix operators only have one "side"; you can imagine that the 
            unused side (e.g. the left side of prefix -) has infinite precedence, so 
            that EC# could parse $-x as $(-x) even though the precedence of '-' is 
            supposedly lower than '$'.
            <para/>
            Some languages have a conditional operator (a?b:c) with three parts. In 
            the middle part, the PF must drop to Precedence.MinValue so that it is 
            possible to parse <c>a?b=x:c</c> even though '=' supposedly has lower 
            precedence than the conditional operator. Note that <c>a=b ? c=d : e=f</c> 
            is interpreted <c>a=(b ? c=d : e)=f</c>, so you can see that the precedence 
            of the conditional operator is higher at the "edges".
            <para/>
            The above explanation illustrates the meaning of Left and Right from the
            perspective of a parser, but an actual parser may or may not use the PF 
            concept and <c>Precedence</c> objects.
            <para/>
            In summary: <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Left"/> and <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Right"/> represent the 
            precedence of the left and right side of a binary operator. A parser can 
            keep track of a number called the "precedence floor" or PF, which has its 
            minimum value when parsing starts. When a binary operator <c>Op</c> is 
            encountered, the parser should "accept" the operator when <c>O.Left > PF</c>
            and, if it accepts the operator, set <c>PF = O.Right</c> temporarily as it 
            parses the right side of the operator.
            <para/>
            This struct contains two other numbers, <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Lo"/> and <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Hi"/>,
            which are a precedence range that determines whether and how the operator 
            can be mixed with other operators, as explained below.
            <para/>
            A printer (which writes a syntax tree as text) has a different way of analyzing
            precedence. It starts with a known parse tree and then has to figure out 
            how to output something that the parser will reconstruct into the original
            tree. This is more difficult if perfect round-tripping is required: parentheses
            are encoded in the Loyc tree as a #trivia_inParens attribute, so if perfect
            round-tripping is desired, the printer cannot simply put everything in parens 
            "just to be safe".
            <para/>
            The LES and EC# printers have two ways of printing any expression tree: (1) 
            with operators (e.g. a+b), and (2) with prefix notation (e.g. `'+`(a, b)).
            The tree <c>`'+`(`'*`(a, b), c)</c> will be printed as "a*b+c" (unless prefix
            notation is specifically requested) because the precedence rules allow it,
            but <c>`'*`(`'+`(a, b), c)</c> will be printed as <c>`'+`(a, b)*c</c> because 
            both "a+b*c" and "(a+b)*c" are different from the original tree.
            <para/>
            While a parser proceeds from left to right, a printer proceeds from parents
            to children. So the printer for `'*`(`'+`(a, b), c) starts at <c>`'*`</c> with no 
            precedence restrictions, and roughly speaking will set the precedence floor
            to <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Les.LesPrecedence"/>.Multiply in order to print its two children.
            Since the precedence of `'+` (Add) is below Multiply, the + operator is not
            allowed in that context.
            <para/>
            Printing has numerous "gotchas"; the ones related to precedence are
            <ol>
            <li>Although <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Les.LesPrecedence"/>.Add has the "same" precedence on the
                Left and Right, <c>`'-`(`'-`(a, b), c)</c> can be printed <c>a - b - c</c> but
                <c>`'-`(a, `'-`(b, c))</c> would have to be printed <c>a - `'-`(b, c)</c> 
                instead. Clearly, the left and right sides must be treated somehow
                differently.</li>
            <li>Similarly, the different arguments in <c>a?b:c</c> and <c>a=>b</c> must
                be treated differently. And careful handling is needed for the dot 
                operator in particular due to its high precedence; e.g. <c>`'.`(a(b))</c> 
                cannot be printed <c>.a(b)</c> because that would mean <c>`'.`(a)(b)</c>.</li>
            <li>The LES parser, at least, allows a prefix operator to appear on the 
                right-hand side of any infix or prefix operator, regardless of the 
                precedence of the two operators; "$ ++x" is permitted even though ++ has
                lower precedence than $. Another example is that <c>a.-b.c</c> can be 
                parsed with the interpretation <c>a.(-b).c</c>, even though '- has 
                lower precedence than '$. Ideally the printer would replicate this 
                rule, but whether it does ot not, it also must take care that 
                <c>`'.`(a, -b.c)</c> is not printed as <c>a.-b.c</c> even though the 
                similar expression <c>`'*`(a, `'-`(b.c))</c> can be printed as <c>a*-b.c</c>.</li>
            <li>Prefix notation is needed when an operator's arguments have attributes;
                <c>`'+`([Foo] a, b)</c> cannot be printed <c>[Foo] a + b</c> because
                that would mean <c>[Foo] `'+`(a, b)</c>.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Printing and parsing are different</h3>
            
            This type contains different methods for printers and parsers. A basic 
            difference between them is that printers must make decisions (of whether
            an operator is allowed or not in a given context) based on both sides of
            the operator and both sides of the context (Left and Right), while parsers
            only have to worry about one side. For example, consider the following 
            expression:
            <code>
                a = b + c ?? d
            </code>
            When the parser encounters the "+" operator, it only has to consider 
            whether the precedence of the <i>left-hand side</i> of the "+" operator
            is above the <i>right-hand side</i> of the "=" operator. The fact that
            there is a "??" later on is irrelevant. In contrast, when printing the 
            expression "b + c", both sides of the subexpression and both sides of the 
            context must be considered. The right-hand side is relevant because if 
            the right-hand operator was "*" instead of "??", the following printout 
            would be wrong:
            <code>
                a = b + c * d   // actual syntax tree: a = `'+`(b, c) * d
            </code>
            The same reasoning applies to the left-hand side (imagine if "=" was 
            "*" instead.)
            <para/>
            So, naturally there are different methods for parsing and printing.
            For printing you can use <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.CanAppearIn(Loyc.Syntax.Precedence)"/>, <see 
            cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.LeftContext(Loyc.Syntax.Precedence)"/> and <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.RightContext(Loyc.Syntax.Precedence)"/>, while for parsing you 
            only need <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.CanParse(Loyc.Syntax.Precedence)"/> (to raise the precedence floor, simply
            replace the current <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence"/> value with that of the new 
            operator). If one chooses to use this type to represent the precedence 
            floor in a parser, the "current" precedence is represented by <see 
            cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Right"/>; the value of <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Left"/> doesn't matter.
            <para/>
            Both printers and parsers can use <see cref="M:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.CanMixWith(Loyc.Syntax.Precedence)"/>.
            
            <h3>Miscibility (mixability)</h3>
            
            <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Lo"/> and <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.Precedence.Hi"/> don't affect how operators are
            parsed into a tree, but are used to request a warning or error if operators
            are mixed improperly. If one operator's range overlaps another AND (the 
            ranges are not equal OR <c>Lo > Hi</c>), then the two operators are 
            immiscible. For example, == and != have the same precedence in EC#, 38..39, 
            so they can be mixed with each other, but they cannot be mixed with &amp; 
            which has the overlapping range 32..45 (this will be explained below.)
            Normally Lo and Hi are set to <c>Min(Left,Right)</c> and <c>Max(Left,Right)</c>
            respectively, but this is not required--in particular, any pair where
            <c>Lo > Hi</c> is used to indicate that the operator cannot be mixed with 
            other operators of the same precedence, even though it can (perhaps) be 
            mixed with others of different precedence. This is called non-associativity. 
            For example, in PHP are not allowed to write an expression such as 
            <c>x > y >= z</c>; to represent this, operators <c>></c> and <c>>=</c> 
            should make <c>Lo > Hi</c>.
            <para/>
            Certain operators should not be mixed because their precedence was originally 
            chosen incorrectly, e.g. x &amp; 3 == 1 should be parsed (x &amp; 3) == 1 but is 
            actually parsed x &amp; (3 == 1). To allow the precedence to be repaired 
            eventually, expressions like x &amp; y == z are deprecated in EC#: the parser will 
            warn you if you have mixed operators improperly. PrecedenceRange describes 
            both precedence and miscibility with a simple range of integers. As mentioned
            before, two operators are immiscible if their ranges overlap but are not 
            identical.
            <para/>
            In LES, the precedence range feature (a.k.a. immiscibility) is also used to 
            indicate that a specific precedence has not been chosen for an operator. 
            If a precedence is chosen in the future, it will be somewhere within the 
            range.
            
            <h3>Overall Range</h3>
            
            By convention, precedence scales range from about 0 to about 100.
            The precedence numbers are stored in this structure as <c>sbyte</c>s, so 
            <c>Left</c>, <c>Right</c>, <c>Lo</c>, and <c>Hi</c> must be between -128 
            and 127.

            <para/>
            When pretty-printing any language as text, it's a challenge to decide
            where to place newlines. You may want to break up long lines into
            shorter ones, as in
            <pre>
            if (ReallyLongIdentifier[Fully.Qualified.Name(multiple, parameters)] 
               > SomeConstant)
            {
               return ReallyLongIdentifier[firstThing + secondThing] 
                  + thirdThing + fourthThing;
            }
            </pre>
            Conversely, you may want to print something on one line that you would
            ordinarily print on two:
            <pre>
                if (c) break;
            </pre>
            Of course, the problem is, you don't know how long the syntax tree 
            will be in text form until after you try to print it.
            <para/>
            My first idea to solve this problem was to use a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)">rope</a> 
            tree data structure - inner syntax trees would produce small strings 
            that could be "roped" together to produce a bigger tree. But ropes tend
            not to use memory efficiently, and there was the challenge, which I 
            didn't see how to solve, of how to keep the tree balanced efficiently 
            (for this particular application perhaps a balanced tree wasn't needed,
            but as a perfectionist I didn't want to implement a "half-baked" data 
            structure.)
            <para/>
            Next I thought of the solution used here, a simpler solution based on an 
            ordinary StringBuilder. My idea was to insert newlines "pessimistically" 
            - insert them everywhere in which they might be needed - and then 
            selectively "revoke" them later if they turn out to be unnecessary. Only 
            the most recently-written newline(s) can be revoked, which keeps the 
            implementation simple and also limits the performance cost of deleting 
            the newlines.
            <para/>
            To use, call Newline() to write a newline (with indentation). To make 
            a decision about whether to keep or revoke the most recent newline(s), 
            call RevokeOrCommitNewlines(cp, maxLineLength) where cp is a "checkpoint"
            representing some point before the first newline want to potentially
            revoke, and maxLineLength is the line length threshold: if the line length 
            after combining lines, starting at the line on which the checkpoint is 
            located, does not exceed maxLineLength, then the newlines are revoked, 
            otherwise ALL newlines are committed (so earlier newlines can no longer 
            be revoked.)
            <para/>
            This design allows a potentially long series of newlines to be deleted
            in the reverse order that they were created, but if any newline is kept
            then previous ones can no longer be deleted.
            <para/>
            For an example of how this is used, see the JSON printer in LLLPG samples

            Helper class for mapping from indexes to SourcePos and back.
            </summary><remarks>
            This class's job is to keep track of the locations of line breaks in order
            to map from indices to SourcePos objects or vice versa. Converting indexes 
            to SourcePos is commonly needed for error reporting; lexers, parsers and 
            code analyzers typically use indexes (simple integers) internally, but must
            convert to SourcePos in order to communicate with the end user. Occasionally
            one may wish to convert in the reverse direction also (SourcePos to index).
            <para/>
            Line breaks themselves are classified as being at the end of each line.
            So if the file is "Bob\nJoe", <c>IndexToLine(3).Line == 1</c>, not 2.
            <para/>
            The outputs are immutable and this class assumes the input file never 
            changes. However, this class is not entirly multi-thread-safe until the 
            entire input file or string has been scanned, since the list of line breaks
            is built on-demand, without locking.

            </summary><remarks>
            This class reads small blocks of bytes from a stream, reloading 
            blocks from the stream when necessary. Data is cached with a pair 
            of character buffers, and a third buffer is used to read from the
            stream. A Stream is required rather than a TextReader because
            TextReader doesn't support seeking.
            <para/>
            This class assumes the underlying stream never changes.
            <para/>
            The stream does not (and probably cannot, if I understand the 
            System.Text.Decoder API correctly) save the decoder state at each block 
            boundary. Consequently, only encodings that meet special constraints
            will work with StreamCharSource. These include Encoding.Unicode,
            Encoding.UTF8, and Encoding.UTF32, but not Encoding.UTF7. Using 
            unsupported encodings will cause exceptions and/or or corrupted data 
            output while reading from the StreamCharSource.
            <para/>
            The decoder must meet the following constraints:
            1. Characters must be divided on a byte boundary. UTF-7 doesn't work 
               because some characters are encoded using Base64.
            2. Between characters output by the decoder, the decoder must be 
               stateless. Therefore, encodings that support compression generally 
               won't work.
            3. The decoder must produce at least one character from a group of 
               8 bytes (StreamCharSource.MaxSeqSize).

            EC# supports a syntax specially designed for macro calls: 
            <code>macroName(args) { stmts; }</code>
            This is stored as a call node with a body, in braces, as its final parameter,
            i.e. it is equivalent to
            <code>macroName(args, { stmts; });</code>
            A similar, but more general feature called "superexpressions" exists in LES.
            <para/>
            Some macros would additionally like to apply themselves to all remaining
            nodes in the current list of statements or expressions, i.e.
            <code>macroName(args); stmts;</code>
            LeMP supports this through the <see cref="P:LeMP.IMacroContext.DropRemainingNodes"/>
            and <see cref="P:LeMP.IMacroContext.RemainingNodes"/> APIs. If your macro wants
            to apply itself to all remaining statements or expressions in the 
            current sequence of nodes, it can set the DropRemainingNodes property 
            to true and then simply incorporate RemainingNodes into its own output
            (if you need to return multiple statements from your macro, use 
            <c>list.AsLNode(CodeSymbols.Splice)</c> to convert a VList{LNode} to an 
            LNode.)
            <para/>
            This extension method helps you by detecting whether the current node
            has a body in braces or not. If the braces are present, the returned
            pair consists of the args shortened by one (i.e.
            <c>ctx.CurrentNode().Args.WithoutLast(1)</c>) and the Args of the "{}"
            braces node. Otherwise, <c>ctx.CurrentNode().Args</c> is the first item
            in the pair.
            <para/>
            In the latter case, if <c>orRemainingNodes</c> then this method sets
            <c>ctx.DropRemainingNodes</c> to true and uses <c>ctx.RemainingNodes</c>
            as the second list. Otherwise the second list is left blank.
