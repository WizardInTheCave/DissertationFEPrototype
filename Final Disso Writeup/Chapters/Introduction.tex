\section{Introduction}

The overall aim of this project is to perform the task of refining a Finite Element Mesh (FEM) using a stress based method as is typical of FEM refinement in conjunction with an approach that uses techniques from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. It should be possible to reason about the quality of a mesh produced using both methods analytically in order to evaluate the success of the approach and potential for continued use.\\

\noindent
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a method widely used across different engineering domains to simulate structures under certain conditions. The method works by taking a geometry defined in continuous terms, discretize it into a mesh system before calculating the property values for each of the discrete elements. This allows engineers to observe the effect the conditions have on the entire structure, see figure 1. \\ 

\noindent
The success of the project will be determined by implementation of a system that is able to combine the two approaches described above in order to refine a mesh to of a quality comparable to that of a successful stress based method.
